# IF-IDF Explanation
# The TF-IDF score for a term t in a document d within a corpus D is calculated 
# using the following formula:

# TF-IDF(t, d, D) = TF(t, d) Ã— IDF(t, D)

# Term Frequency (TF): Assigns higher weight to terms that appear frequently in a document. 
# If a term appears often in a document, it might be important.

# Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Assigns higher weight to terms that appear in fewer 
# documents across the corpus. Rare terms across all documents get a higher IDF, 
# highlighting their uniqueness.

# By multiplying TF and IDF, the TF-IDF score balances the frequency of a term in a specific 
# document against its frequency across the entire corpus, effectively highlighting terms 
# that are significant to a particular document.

# HIGH TF-IDF Score: Indicates that the term is very relevant to the document 
# (it appears frequently in that document but not in many documents in the corpus).

# LOW TF-IDF Score: Indicates that the term is common across documents (e.g., common stop words) 
# or does not appear frequently in the document.

# Plotting Term Frequency Distributions ----------------------------------------

# We can visualize the distribution of term frequencies in each novel.

# Zipf's Law -------------------------------------------------------------------

# versus rank on a log-log scale.
