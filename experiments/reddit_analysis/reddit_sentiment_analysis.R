#### Exploring Sentiment Lexicons ####
# The tidytext package includes several sentiment lexicons that we can use.

# View the sentiments dataset
print(head(sentiments))
# The dataset contains words along with their associated sentiments from different lexicons.

# Get specific sentiment lexicons using get_sentiments()
afinn <- get_sentiments("afinn")  # AFINN lexicon with numeric sentiment scores
bing <- get_sentiments("bing")    # Bing lexicon with positive/negative sentiments
nrc <- get_sentiments("nrc")      # NRC lexicon with various emotions and sentiments

# All three lexicons are based on unigrams, i.e., single words. These lexicons 
# contain many English words and the words are assigned scores for positive/negative 
# sentiment, and also possibly emotions like joy, anger, sadness, and so forth. 
# The NRC lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion (“yes”/“no”) into categories 
# of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust.

# View the first few entries of each lexicon
