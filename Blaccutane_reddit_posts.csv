Blaccutane,148g9ee,Nervous Milia Removal,I'm having the milia on my right cheek removed on June 27. (BTW I've had the milia long before Accutane and my acne breakouts.) I trust my dermatologist completely. She's freaking amazing. She advised me to use my hydroquinone twice daily on the area 2 weeks before the procedure to prevent PIH and to stay inside as much as possible and wear hats while they heal. I don't want to start over with the fading process on my cheek but I **HATE** the way the milia look. They look like a cluster of pimples. I will be 99% happy with my overall Accutane journey without them. I want them gone!! Ughhh!!!!,Sending you love and light. You’re so beautiful I remember your pictures. This is going to go incredibly well!

Ughhh!!!!,If you’re no longer on accutane I highly recommend incorporating tretinoin and or Azelaic acid to your routine! (I use both and it’s helped me get rid of milia)

I will be 99% happy with my overall Accutane journey without them. I want them gone!! Ughhh!!!!,My dermatologist has me on tazarotene. I’ve been on it for about 3 weeks. I’m trying to get up to the point of everyday instead of 4 times a week because of the irritation. I don’t want my skin to flake off but this is probably the best time to do it. I’m a teacher and on vacation now so nobody will really see my skin except for family.

Blaccutane,147k2p8,Skincare tips,Hey everyone! I just finished my 2nd month on accutane (2nd time I’ve been on it as well) and my progress is not where I thought it would be. The first time round my skin had pretty much cleared up by month 2 and it hasn’t. I know this can happen but I wanted to get some tips from you all. I was wondering if I could some tips for what moisturizer and cleanser I should use I never know which one to get. Right I wash my face my african black soap 3 times a week at night and the rest of the times I just wash it with water. As my moisturizer I use a Aloe Vera everyday. Which products should I get? My skin used to be oily and now it has dried out which is good so I would love some recommendations for dry skin. Also on the accutane reddit they always mention the importance of sunscreen. Does that apply to us too? If so which one should I get because I’m out in the sun a lot. I live in Europe btw. Thank you again!,I think the black soap is too harsh imo

Thank you again!,You should always be applying sunscreen at least 2 to 3 times a day and especially while you’re on this medication. Don’t use the African black soap. Use a gentle cleanser twice a day. I cannot stress this enough but wearing sunscreen is the most important step in any routine. And drinking drinking a lot of water.

Blaccutane,145dyuo,Amnesteen/Mobility Loss,Has anyone else experienced this? I had to stop my medication two weeks in because I couldn't walk anymore due to severe knee joint pain. I healed 4 days after I stopped my prescription. I didn't have Meg knees to begin with but this was bad. I just want clear skin 😩,I had that when I worked out or took long walks. Stretching really helped for me.

I just want clear skin 😩,You needed to take it with 2400 2800 mg of fish oil per dose and increase water intake significantly

I wasn't taking up to 2800mg of Fish Oil and I'm probably not drinking enough water. I go back to the dermatologist next week so I may have to decrease my dosage.

Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Yes!!! It will and it’s the reason I was on three months longer. Absorbica is way better and to save you my headache and heartache start taking 2400 2800 mg of fish oil with each dose daily
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Two different brands didn’t change anything but I was never on Absorbica.
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Thank you! I agree because I think I’m done purging & my face looks completely different compared to month 1. Did you purge again when you switched?
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Did you ever make a change w/ in accutane brands?
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Yes I did badly! And I had to start the fish oil but I didn’t do that for at least three months of struggle and ugliness. I was in so much pain I could barely walk. Someone on here suggested fish oil and of course increase water intake. I did that and finally 11 months later I got off of the accutane. Now I’m slowly fading hyperpigmentation that no doubt is worse because I was taken off Absorbica and now I have to get peels. I got one it did nothing and I didn’t even peel. Next up in July I’ll get a higher strength. Hoping that ends this whole process. I’m also on arazlo which is gentler than tret and it’s seems promising
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Yes. I started with Amneal then Claravis and back to Amneal.
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,What other changes did you notice once you were switched?
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,It wasn’t as effective because I wasn’t ingesting enough fat. Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin so save yourself the headache and take the fish oil and a spoonful of peanut butter or ice cream.
