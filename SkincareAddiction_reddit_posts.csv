It’s the only thing I found that made a noticeable difference (improvement) for my skin. I have dry skin. I think it’s partially the fact that it’s quite thick and almost a paste like substance that really works for me. I can’t afford it anymore. I’m disabled and unable to work. So spending €30 on a tiny tube isn’t something I can do anymore. Looking for recommendations available in Ireland (or UK) for a moisturiser that is thick and paste like in a similar way. Thanks!

Right now I have: AM The inkey list 10% azaelic acid serum (every other day) Garnier skin active daily moisturizer / sunscreen AND sometimes glow recipe niancinamide hue drops OR supergoop glow screen depending how much coverage I want that day PM (this is the mess) cerave salycilic acid cleanser (don’t love it but I’ll finish the bottle) the ordinary peptides + HA serum malin + goetz recovery treatment oil (don’t know what this does but I love how it makes my skin feel and look) inkey list retinol eye cream (when I can tolerate it I’m finding it super drying for my eyes themselves) L’Oréal revitalift night moisturizer (don’t love it either but will finish the bottle) OR cerave pm moisturizer on alternative days My questions: I want to use a better retinol when I finish the L’Oréal revitalift (I think it has some absurdly low amount and I haven’t really seen a difference so far) but I think I’ll need an additional moisturizer when I get there as this one doesn’t leave me too dry right now. Is that generally right? would it be effective to use the peptides in the morning with the azaelic acid? I work from home so a longer skin routine is fine then but I’m usually quite lazy at night and don’t like a drawn out routine I’m finding. is there something important I’m missing here in the routine? Ie not moisturizing enough after the actives. In particular I’m wondering what I could add around my eyes to make them tolerate the retinol eye cream more. My main concerns are anti aging and redness. The azaelic has been crazy good for the redness but I’m not really seeing my impact in my deeper lines so far so I feel like my anti aging is not going as well. Any help would be appreciated!

1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,If after all these years if all I had to do was drink tea I might just end myself lol
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,What brand of tea do you use? Lol I want the exact same thing you’re drinking!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,This is great congrats! I tried 1 cup daily spearmint tea for about 2 weeks and it delayed my period so bad that was one of the worst cycles ever I felt awful. I stopped drinking it and got back on track. I was recently prescribed Winlevi topical cream for hormonal acne. So far it’s going good. No new breakouts.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Be careful with spearmint tea!! Not directed at you OP just for those reading the reason it works is because it affects your hormones. Have a chat to your doctor before you start taking it as it can have some pretty rough effects like inflamed liver insomnia painful breasts nightmares… it can work incredibly well for acne but be aware of the risk!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,For those worried about their cycles I take spironolactane which is also an anti androgen. It messed up my cycle in the beginning but eventually helped make my cycle more regular than before I was on it
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Looks amazing how long did it take for spearmint tea to show results for you?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,does this work for men too?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I’ve always had very acne prone and problematic skin but the change I’ve seen in the last few months is insaneeee. The only thing I did was start drinking spearmint tea 3 4 times a week. My routine has been the same for ~4 years now after I finished accutane and my acne came back 6 months later. AM ROUTINE: Heritage Store rose water toner (going forward this is between Every single skincare step) The Ordinary Niacinamide & Zinc CeraVe Vitamin C serum Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid Vanicream moisturizer Trader Joe’s sunscreen PM ROUTINE: (Only if wearing makeup) Palmers Skin Therapy Cleansing Oil CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser Prescribed Tretinoin 1% Good Molecules Hyaluronic acid Vanicream moisturizer CeraVe healing ointment to glaze face before bed I’m only posting my routine to meet the post requirements honestly I don’t think anyone would benefit from doing my routine simply bc my skin has always sucked ass and products have never made a big difference. Only accutane and now spearmint tea has actually cleared my skin up so 🙃🙃 Top 3 products though because apparently I have to: Hyaluronic acid (my skin is super dry and anything to hydrate is life saving) Vanicream moisturizer (again only the thickest for my dry ass skin) Trader Joe’s sunscreen
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Did it lower your libido?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I love spearmint tea but just fyi — not everybody should drink it! It can increase your risk of developing blood clots. If you’re taking medications (like certain birth controls) that can make you more prone to them you should avoid consistent supplementation. :)
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I want to thank you for posting this because the comments have taught me something new and quite mind blowing to me. The comments mentioned spearmint lowering testosterone levels. I have PCOS and my five o'clock shadow is very real. I wondered if it's been used for PCOS and found there has been several quite good studies done showing it can benefit the condition. Possibly not the revelation that was intended but I have something new to try now! Thanks again!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Omg stop I wish it worked so well for me
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Does drinking peppermint tea have the same effects or does it only work with spearmint?

1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,So happy for you! This is some seriously glowing and healthy skin. 😍 I started drinking 4 cups a day way back in august 2024 for my PCOS hirsutism. So far my chest and chin hair got more but my skin got a lot clearer. 😅
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Despite the acne your skin looks so hydrated and nourished in both pictures! I have such dry skin and everything seems oily to me how do you hydrate?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I’ve had some spearmint tea just sitting on my counter that I occasionally drink but this really just motivated me to be consistent with drinking. Started breaking out terribly over the past few months and am at my wits end. Thank you!!

1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,loooovvveee spearmint tea for my cystic acne. It does significantly delay ovulation with makes your cycle abnormally long like 35 40days (for me atleast) i like this effect as i dont have any other side effects around my cycle from it and its nice to have more time between periods. its gotten to the point where if i need to control when my period starts i can delay it or have it come sooner just by drinking or not drinking the tea
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,if drinking tea is what I've had to do this entire time I'm going to gnaw off my dick
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I use the traditional medicinals cycle tea and it’s that girl for me. Two bags in a coffee mug is my daily dose (I do still use Adapalene Klaron and dapsone which all helped but the tea really does keep me clear).

1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,This means your body has too much testosterone spearmint reduces it!

1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Okayyyy I just bought mine yesterday!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Not to be dumb but are you using the tea on your skin topically or drinking? I only ask because a lactation consultant once recommended pouring organic peppermint tea on a skin issue to clear it up but I never tried!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Yep! I love Clear Within Skin Detox tea has other ingredients for liver support too. My naturopath gave it her thumbs up
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,This just convinced me to order some lol any kind in particular you recommend?

1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Will this work if your testosterone levels are normal? I just had a blood test to see if that’s causing my acne and it’s in the normal range
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Just started after learning about it on this subreddit. Had mild hormonal acne—out of nowhere it was getting bad. My skin has started clearing up. I’m amazed

1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Not the same girl.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,This is how I feel about salicylic acid... I've always avoided it because my sister is allergic. Just kinda assumed I was too. She's older so I watched her struggle as a little girl and just never thought differently. Guess who's acne is completely cleared 2 months after starting a salicylic acid treatment 🙃
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I promise you it's not. It really varies person to person. I tried the tea thing for weeks it did not help me.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Exactly how I was feeling hahah
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I tried SA for like 3 weeks and my skin got so much worse. I started having breakouts and I know it's not purging because when I took a break my skin got a lot better ☹️
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,ive been praising spearmint for years. as a teen and years of research it was the one thing that cleared my acne significantly. i don’t drink it anymore but i swear it balanced my skin sm… i was constantly for over a year… then weaned off over the course of another two years and haven’t had that level of acne since.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,😂
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,LOL
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Traditional Medicinals! Just the basic grocery store brand lol I hope the brand doesn’t matter too much since I just got a bunch of loose leaf spearmint from a local tea shop
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It literally does not matter the effect comes from the plant. as long as it is actually spear or peppermint you're good. edit: my bad *spear*mint
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Search your city for loose leaf bulk tea shop. Keep it local. They will likely have several tea kettle options available too. I started with tea bags but quickly realized loose leaf is the way to go. Good luck!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,[deleted]
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Oh man! :( That is important to point out actually since spearmint affects hormonal function that’s why it works well for some people and isn’t good for others
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,There’s a cream for hormonal acne?? What is it??
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I also had delayed ovulation and period. By a lot. Sucks because it improved my skin noticeably. Gonna try drinking it only on the last half of my cycle
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Okay this might be a stupid question but why would a delayed period/ ovulation be bad? Why’d you feel awful?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Same here! Sorry to hear this happened to you but glad I’m not alone 😭
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Oooo shit good to know
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I drank spearmint tea for my acne and it made me insanely anxious and I started getting panic attacks and had difficulty sleeping. It took me ages to realize what was causing it. I stopped the tea and I went back to normal. Please be aware of the risks when trying this.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Yes exactly! It just so happens that I have the weird balance of hormones that makes spearmint effective like this. I tried drinking it before bed once though and I had the weirdest and most vivid dreams and I’m never doing that again lol
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Does anyone know if it affects oral combination birth control? I'm on Hailey Fe 1/20 (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol). I don't currently have a doctor due to insurance issues but hopefully someone knows as my bc is pretty common
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,This is so real. Had the clearest skin of my life but after consistently drinking it for a few weeks it gave me an ovarian cyst the size of a lemon that ruptured. It was one of the most painful things that’s ever happened to me. Stopped drinking it and haven’t had anything like that since soo not worth it.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Yep my pictures look like the reverse of OPs after a cup of spearmint tea.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I think it lowers testosterone levels too. My friend’s hair was falling out a lot and her doctor told her that her testosterone levels were too high and that she should drink mint tea daily.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Thank you for saying this.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Also might impact supply if breastfeeding Some people drink it while weaning. I did and it worked so well it was scary. I would say don’t drink it while breastfeeding just in case!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Typical reddit response
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I’m also on spironolactone! It has some cool side effects I’m enjoying lol.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Im thinking if starting Spiro in April when I have my derm appointment! Can you give some feedback on it?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I noticed an improvement within a week or two of daily tea!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,don't take antiandrogens as a man. there's some evidence that spearmint only affects free testosterone so in theory it shouldn't completely wreck you but it's still probably not something men should attempt without medical supervision.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Am very curious about this. 😅 I’m just concerned it affects our hormones differently from girls.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,What brand of spearmint tea are you drinking?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Just spearmint tea like just spearmint no black/green/white tea or other additives? I have to try it
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I tried spearmint tea for my PCOS and all it did was give me palpitations and make my period go wonky that month 😬 not fun!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I have PCOS. I started drinking spearmint tea and it helped with acne and facial hair a lot. My period was surprisingly regular so all it did was ease my cramps during my period. Hair also stopped falling off but I don't know if that is due to me drinking different oils daily (fish flax seed pumpkin) or the spearmint. Only drawback is drinking it forever for the rest of your life. I got tired and my symptoms came back😭. I need to get on the train again. Also took a week to see results I think I put a high concentration of leaves though.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Only works with spearmint. Peppermint doesn’t have the same hormone balancing properties which is why spearmint can work like this for some people!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,5 months but I could have taken an after photo like 4 months ago I just never thought to do it. I noticed improvements within 1 2 weeks
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,how often do you drink it now?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,which ones do you use??
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Fucking same. Like I’ma rip it out like a turnip.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,does it really? i always thought i have too much estrogen
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Drinking the tea! I haven’t tried it but have always wanted to
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,No. Spearmint tea is an imprecise but sometimes effective way of somewhat controlling hormonal acne. Spironolactone does the same thing only it does it with consistency and is regulated unlike herbs.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Im the opposite salicylic and benzoyl have never worked for me in my 20 years of acne. Its weird how some types of acne respond to different things.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I hear you. I tried literally everything and it just pissed my skin off. Turns out that I have acne rosacea and everything I was doing made it so much worse. Apparently glycolic acid and rough exfoliation are the worst thing you can do for acne rosacea. Oops. I’m so thankful for my dermatologist. It took 3 to get the correct diagnosis.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,This is how I feel about zinc oxide! I bought a zinc oxide facial sunscreen in a pinch and it cleared my skin up and now it’s so soft and calm.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,What salicylic acid treatment did you use?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I used to drink spearmint/peppermint tea all the time in the past clear skin etc. Then it stopped working and I had to do spiro. Now every time i drink spearmint tea i feel sick
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Same girl!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Yeah my skin is eternally dry and red and acne filled but all moisturizers break me out. Tried sa as well but I’m too dry for it so that irritates my skin and then the moisturizer to mitigate the irritation causes me to break out. All I can use is water and Vaseline seemingly but then again that’s all I’ve done recently and still broke out. It’s an endless cycle of breakouts haha
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Salicylic acid is one of those things that’s really potent. So for the right person it’s a godsend but for many people it’s like throwing gasoline on a fire. I’m the latter type. Turns out my teen acne hung out in my early 20’s more because of the harsh acne products I was using rather than hormones.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Also purging is kind of a myth. I learned that from Dr. Dray.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I love Traditional Medicinals for their Throat Coat tea. It’s a freaking miracle drink as a singer with silent reflux and craniofacial weirdness that makes mucus buildup screw me over more than others. However it’s unfortunately not a cure. Thankfully I no longer have serious acne issues so I can’t speak for the spearmint tea but I can say that I haven’t been able to find a blend of tea that works the same wonders as Throat Coat original.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I love traditional medicinals for their quality blends and convince but yall can just buy bulk loose peppermint leaf from Frontier herbs (bulk seasoning shop) and it's way more cost effective and you can use a reusable tea ball and not have to deal with throwing out tea bags. I love the bulk herb route bc it tastes fresher and you can change the concentration of your tea easier
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Which grocery store has it ?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Same!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Not peppermint.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Updateme! 5hrs
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Does anyone know if it affects oral combination birth control? I'm on Hailey Fe 1/20 (norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol)
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I recently bought some Spearmint Tea would you recommend a woman to drink it *AFTER* their menstrual cycle ends?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Is it bad for men?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Yeah I had no clue either! It’s called Winlevi. I’m sensitive to taking any oral prescriptions so my derm said she wants me to try it and that she uses it herself.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,You can also try dapsone. It helped me within a week.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It’s topical spironolactone called Winlevi! (Not sure about the spelling)
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Because panic ensued thinking I was pregnant 🤣
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,when your period is consistent and regular a change signals something weird is happening
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It gave me palpitations I’m on ADHD meds so maybe it interacted weirdly with those but I felt awful for weeks.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I have issues with spearmint tea as well. But it works so well in helping calm/clear my face. I started using a tea that' is a herbal blend Has spearmint chamomile and some other herbs. I started just brewing the tea then using the tea bag as a poultice and this has worked well for me. But not drinking the tea.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,that is sooo interesting i'm thinking of talking it before bed just to try 🤣
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I always take it before bed and it doesn't affect me. But I suspect my estrogen is a bit high
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I’m on the same pill and it can absolutely affect birth control. I would not mix them.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,My apologies for trying to give people a heads up in case they experience pain and discomfort lol
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I’m struggling to stay hydrated enough to not have dry…throat? but otherwise I’m liking it too
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It works really well for me made my hair healthier too BUT I am thirsty all the time. Be prepared to go NOWHERE without hydration with you
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I was on Spironolactone for 7 years. It really helped my hormonal cystic acne! Some downfalls include frequent urination (not awful but increase thirst with it) increased potassium levels (blood checks every 3 6 months depending on your dosage) birth defects (make sure you’re on birth control!) and breast tenderness. The minor side effects were worth it in my opinion. Please be aware it’s not a cure so it only works when you’re taking it. I recently stopped taking it and my birth control to begin to try to start a family and my acne came back with a vengeance.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Daily once or twice?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,oh shit i was about to buy a bunch of this stuff thanks for looking out!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Salicylic acid without fail makes my acne worse it sucks 😫
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,What worked for you?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Tried electo plasma ?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Omg I think I have the same thing how did you manage to clear yours up ?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Please share with us!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Thats so cool! I might try that
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Im using the La Roche Posay Effaclar acne treatment system! Stuff is strong though. I started by using the face wash once a day the toner every 3 days and the spot treatment as needed (i don't recommend using the toner and spot treatment the same days when starting out. Gave myself a small chem burn. It didnt scar luckily). After 2 weeks I switched to using the toner every other day. I'm now able to use it every day and use the face wash twice a day if I need to. Toner only once at night. I've been using the entire system since December 15th!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Spiro didn’t work and it messed up my period so much.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Have you tried Vanicream? I haven't found any other moisturizer that doesn't irritate me or break me out.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,This !! It sucks cuz I have some texture on my forehead but cannot seem to remove it no matter what I try. I'll try with BHA next stick to it for a few weeks and see how it goes 😞
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,For me I can use it everyday and see no effect positive or negative.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I know many people have split opinions on that you think it could have been irritation?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Peppermint is different to spearmint though if you mean buying dried spearmint in bulk that’s a great point.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It can absolutely affect birth control. Call the nurse’s line at your OBGYN for confirmation.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,No it doesn't. I take oral BCP and spearmint tea daily
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It could be as it reduces testosterone
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Yes. I wouldn’t recommend it for men as it is an anti androgen.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,WHAT.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I used Winlevi for a long time. It’s amazing for my hormonal acne but I can’t afford the out of pocket right now. My blood pressure is naturally very low and Spiro made it drop so dangerously low that I constantly felt like I was going to pass out. Winlevi is a great alternative to systemic meds. Hopefully we’ll get a generic soon.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Omg WinLevi is THAT GURL. My doc prescribed it to me (in combination with Tri Luma) about four years ago and my skin was never better. I was literally glowing. I need to do it again :( The only thing that sucked was how much sunscreen I had to go through!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I’m been on winlevi for two weeks and survived my cycle with no acne. It’s been a miracle for me
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,What’s dapsone? Birth control?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Oooooh! Okay yeah that’s fair 🤣 I’ve never had a consistent period and I regularly take tests anyway so that didn’t really occur to me lol
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Sure but in this case you know what the something weird is?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Woah... I've been taking spearmint capsules and have been having pain in my breasts and heart palpitations like crazy. I wonder if decreasing the daily dose to twice a week or so would help.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Yeah I’m struggling with hydration too. That’s one thing that DOES suck but honestly what’s the worst that will happen? I’ll build better water drinking habits? It’s hard because you also need to watch your potassium on spironolactone so I’m not comfortable with most electrolyte solutions and sports drinks. If you have the grocery budget for it mixing tart cranberry juice lemon or lime juice salt and soda water can be a really hydrating and delicious.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Emotional support water bottle is real
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Just once! And now I’m down to about 3 times a week for maintenance
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,you're very welcome! there's a cream called Winlevi it's a topical antiandrogen and the only (to my knowledge) antiandrogenic anti acne treatment that's safe for men to use since it only affects the concentration of DHT in skin not in your entire system. if you want to try this route ask your dermatologist for a prescription!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It doesn’t do anything for me except dry me out.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Mine too.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Same!!!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Its so random but the St. Ives Glycolic Acid Toner and just using a toner in general after cleansing. Edit: I should elaborate on my acne type its like small bumps on my cheeks jaw and temples. They never got red or inflamed just tons of small stubborn acne bumps.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Spironolactone lol
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,No I havent
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I did a 2 month doxycycline purge and still take it twice daily and have prescriptions for metronidazole gel and Clindamycin gel that I apply twice daily. I use La roche posay Effaclar cleanser for thick skin and Paula’s Choice salicylic acid exfoliant. I like bentonite clay mixed with apple cider vinegar as a mask but I use zitsticka pore vac in the winter otherwise my skin gets really dry. Eva’s naturals has a really good Vitamin C serum and it’s worked wonders. My moisturizer is the No 7 future renew day cream with sunscreen and night cream. I add bio oil at night if needed for dryness. Everything I use besides the moisturizers can be really drying so be careful with it. Biodance has an overnight collagen sleep mask that helps with putting moisture back in your skin I swear by them and use one whenever I do a mask. I take things out of my routine and add them back in depending on how dry my skin is. And don’t forget to check your makeup products. When I wear makeup it’s bare minerals because everything else I tried broke me out.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Yes! I had to stop spiro because it absolutely ruined my menstrual cycle
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Do you mind if I ask you about this? I have been taking spiro for about 6 months and I think it is working. But I’ve had spotting before and after my period. What did you end up doing instead?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I second this one. I have very sensitive skin and it’s one of the only things that works for me too
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,No I haven’t I’ve seen people either love it or hate it when I’ve done my Google/Reddit searching. Thanks I’ll give It a try!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,"That seems more likely. Because if you think aboit it acne can heal from the inside of the pore so it doesnt make much sense that it would ""get worse before it gets better"" kind of thing. Maybe with irritation that could be true like with my daily retinol my skin was a little dry from it but my acne itsself didnt get worse in the beginning."
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I misspoke lol running on very few hours of sleep! Lol
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It's nowhere near powerful enough to impact men's natural testosterone levels
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It’s a newer medication and has no generic available so it’s expensive for Americans even with insurance usually sadly. But that may be why you haven’t heard of it yet it only became available a couple of years ago
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It’s going to be very expensive. Check into coupon cards for it
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It’s a cream :) just use in morning and I still use tret at night
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,no?? that's what i'll try to find out
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I just looked it up. The brand of cranberry juice I buy contains approx 6% of your daily potassium needs. With the lemon juice this concoction is no lower in potassium than a Gatorade or packet of liquid IV. I still prefer homemade hydration for other reasons but I feel so stupid having recommended that recipe under a comment discussing spironolactone 🤣. Cheers.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,That sounds delicious!! Thank you!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I make sure to bring it even when I’m only leaving the house for 20 min. You never know when it will suddenly zap all moisture from your mouth and throat
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,the word antiandrogen freaks me out. think i'll pass before i do something stupid
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,oh wow this is also awesome to know about as someone who's been contemplating taking T but is very anxious about the potential for bad breakouts
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,"There's a new prescription that's basically topical spironolactone that doesn't give you the other system effects that spironolactone does (diuretic affects wonky menstrual cycle). I highly recommend it if you can get it. It's somewhat newer though so it may not be available in your country or covered by insurance. Ask your derm. You normally have to ""fail"" other topical prescriptions before this is an option but if you're on oral spironolactone you're probably either there or not far off. The name brand is Winlevi and the active ingredient is clascoterone."
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I had the spotting too. Then my periods got really heavy. I stopped taking it a few months ago but my periods are still adjusting.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Third for vanicream!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,ima chime in here and say i didn’t like vanicream…felt too heavy even tho i have sensitive dehydrated acne/eczema prone skin. i just never felt like it absorbed that well and id wake up greasy
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,No worries!! Happens to us all haha.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,If someone is drinking 2 3 cups a day for acne reasons enough to alter the menses cycles and testosterone levels in women it is reasonable to assume that this is an amount outside of moderate consumption and can in fact also affect testosterone levels in men
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,It kinda stopped working after 3 months ngl
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I hear compounding pharmacies can offer it at a much better price.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Of course! I’d love to talk to a couple people about their experiences with spironolactone tbh I’m just so curious. Can I message you?
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,this is not medical advice by any means but if facial hair is something you'd like to achieve on T then you probably shouldn't use Winlevi until you already have solid hair growth. if you start using it right away the hair follicles won't respond to T the way they should and you may end up with a patchy goat beard situation. lots of very effective non hormonal anti acne options out there so don't worry too much!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Topical spironolactone simply didn’t come close to the same skin clearing as the oral spironolactone for me. My dermatologist cautioned me of those findings ahead of time but I gave it a couple of months of my best patience before it just was intolerable. So I’m back on the oral but I never had spotting. Maybe topical is good for less severe breakouts? Just not for me. And it’s definitely better on hormones though agreed.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Winlevi just gave me contact dermatitis over my entire face.
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Men's testosterone levels are MUCH higher than women's
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,I'm on spiro too you can DM if you'd like!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Sure!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,good to know thank you! I'm actually iffy on whether I would want any facial hair so that might also be useful in the inverse way :) I'll have to look into it a bit more!
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,That doesn’t mean a drop in it won’t affect them
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,The sheer amount of tea required to have any meaningful and genuine impact on a man with normal starting testosterone levels would be ludicrous
1ivkcsn,[Before&After] Spearmint tea is THAT girl,,Also in Morocco they drink nothing else than mint tea and the men are doing just fine.
1iwbnca,[Trigger Warning],hi i have a self harm scar thats about a year old. its very raised and red and i was wandering if anyone had any non surgical ways to improve the appearance or make it less noticeable? im 16 and my parents dont know and dont have the money for anything surgical so i was just wandering if anyone of you guys have advice or products you recommend thank you so much,Silicone scar tape for sure. Most scientifically effective thing on the market for scars and provides a moist flattening environment that makes keloids much less noticeable/go away.

This was many years ago and over time it has faded a lot. Keep it moisturized and use sunblock diligently if you're wearing clothing that exposes it. Be patient.

It needs to be injected with a strong steroid which only a doctor can do. Then laser afterwards if it is still red. It’s not cheap to do the laser if you are in the United States. You could try the highest strength topical steroid ointment you can get your hands on directly to the big raised area but don’t put it on the other scars or normal skin bc can make that worse Also keep sunscreen on it or covered to prevent sun damage which can potentially make it worse or hyperpigment. I am sorry you going through this but many people have these and you should be proud for what you have overcome.

You can also try scar massage. Use an oil like vitamin E even olive oil could work if youve got some at home. You're gonna apply firm not hard pressure on the scar with the pads of your fingers and gently massage the scar in circular motions. apply enough pressure to move the skin beneath the scar while moving along the length of the scar. It shouldn't hurt. If it does back off with the pressure you're applying . youll want to do this several times a day for best results . You're essentially trying to.break.down that band of hypertrophic /thickened scar tissue. You've got this hang in there ! 💜

I had a couple that looked exactly like that and thought they were keloids. I basically just kept everything moisturized with gentle lotion and kept them covered. I want to tell you that almost 20 years later I forget they’re there. They’re flat and light pink now and the other scars are barely noticeable thin white lines. I really want to tell you this because at the time I didn’t think there’d be a “20 years later” for me. Things do get better.

I agree with others start using silicone tape for sure. I was able to successfully treat a newly formed keloid with silicone tape. The scar isn’t completely gone but it’s flat and fairly close to my skin color. Do stay out of the sun as others mentioned. I wish you the best I hope you are healing emotionally as well.

A keloid is a form of benign fibrosis caused by inflammation produced from the scar tissue. You most probably have a genetic tendency to form keloids whenever you have an open scar. This includes everything from little bruises to surgical scars. They are not that much of a problem if you try to prevent before they are formed. Even if you have them they are generally very harmless besides the look. For any keloids you already have: \ Laser therapy is an option but it doesn't seem plausible since you're a teenager and want to keep this as a secret. \ Steroid injections by a doctor might be a necessity. It's a very simple procedure that improves the puffiness of the scar and flatten it. \ You can try to get a scar gel named contractubex. It has soothing effects on the tissue and I don't know if it's a prescription drug or not where you live. It might improve it's color if you can dedicate yourself to use it regularly. \ Use sunscreen on keloids. This is really important to not make them any worse than they are at the moment. \ Someone mentioned the surgical removing as an option however this is a false hope. Researches are clear that nearly 100% of keloids return after surgical removal so the best way to fight keloid is to never let it form in the first place. So for any future keloids you might form: \ Like I said don't get cuts in the first place. This is the best way to prevent keloids. \ When you need a surgical operation tell your doctor that you have a tendency to form keloids. They will have a steroid application on your scar while they are operating on you which will reduce the possibility that you form one. They might use a more aesthetic suture and also give you a topical steroid to use while your scar heals. \ For any small bruises/cuts etc. you should use contractubex/a steroid cream you have with silicon scar sheets on top of it in order to prevent keloids. Topical steroid creams are also used for eczema treatment so your local pharmacy must have it. These are the options. Sorry for the situation that you're in. I hope you can recover & stay keloid free.

You could use silicone scar sheets to maybe reduce its appearance a bit over time. Some people are just prone to this sort of scarring so you should probably avoid piercings in the future as well.

Give it about two more years they will naturally deflate... it'll most likely still have some texture when you run your finger over it but it'll withdraw and turn white eventually. please don't listen to people telling you to get surgery!

I have a big scar that’s darker than yours and raised up too and that’s what my dermatologist recommended too. it’s seriously unbelievable how much it actually helped to lighten it up and blend my scar in with the surrounding skin. Would recommend 10/10

If injections are done on an area that is rarely irritated it can help with discoloration and size. I have some on the back of my shoulder that have went from red to skin toned after a series of 4 injections monthly and shrunk about 30%. But if done in an area that moves a lot or gets irritated often it becomes more of a temporary relief. Injections are not a permanent fix but more of subduing the symptoms. To fully remove a keloid you would need to have it surgically removed but risk gaining another keloid if not bigger. The best advice I can give is to try your best to not irritate it (i.e scratching rubbing) and use the silicon gel/tape the others are suggesting.

Difference is hypertrophic scars are only as broad as the wound and though they take a while eventually reduce and flatten. Keloids will tend to grow and expand beyond the original wound over time and grow taller too at that point you need surgery to stop it and remove it. I got a hypertrophic scar recently from accidentally grating my finger quite deeply on a cheese grater. Because the scar that formed was raised and thick and red I worried it was a keloid it was also sensitive for a couple of months say if I knocked it but that’s gone away now and it’s started to flatten and turn more brown/skin coloured.

1iwcpme,[ACNE] Strange acne flare up. 14 year old. Please suggest remedies. Thank you 🙏,,This looks like a fungal acne break out. All that means is that it’s happening due to sweat and moisture. Differin can actually cause more acne I would recommend trying to clear it with salicylic acid and dandruff shampoo. It will also clear up if she keeps her pillow cases clean washes her hair and face and keeps her face moisturized but patted dry after exercise/school. I sometimes get more breakouts like this when I use sun screen. There is a witch hazel and salicylic acid cleanser you can get from the dollar store that is pretty effective. It’s called skin nutrition botanicals. Just make sure she moisturizes with it with maybe a water based moisturizer.
