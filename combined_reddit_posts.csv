"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""","This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life, months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response, because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it, without a shadow of a doubt, per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear, definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly, no, not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's, and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly, since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line, their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This, and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light, prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So, we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature, it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist), but logically and mechanistically, we can find a few things. For example, we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings, parents, or grandparents have the specific health issues you have, (and, more importantly, did they develop it at such a young age)? If so, then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things, if not, this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself, what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so, then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not, it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line, many years later. **On another note, we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik, Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative, chronic) that occur further down the line, years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands. It does not selectively target sebum/oil glands of the skin, however; it also reduces glands in other body structures: synovial membranes, meibomian glands, mucocutaneous glands, etc). * Accutane kills stem cells. Stem cells are necessary for lifelong repair of tissues. * Accutane changes genetic expression of at least 500 (likely more) genes..this has been shown in studies. * Accutane causes oxidative damage to the DNA and tissues of the body * A study showed that at least 7% (this is in clinical trials with close monitoring; these days, often doctors encourage patients to continue their treatment despite displaying side effects that could become permanent) have permanent physiological changes post accutane. * Accutane has been shown in histological studies to change tissues including skin, tendons, nerves, cartilage, bone, and brain. * Accutane changes the expression of critical connective tissue proteins in the body: downregulates hyaluronic acid (the water holding molecule that keeps your joints, skin, and other connective tissues healthy and plump), downregulates collagen (in skin and connective tissue, the 'matrix' protein of the body), and downregulates elastin (the protein that keeps your connective tissues pliable and elastic). * Thousands upon thousands of people have described eerily similar serious health issues occurring post accutane, some with occuring rapidly, and some slowly over time. These people all describe having no risks of these conditions in their family, and being perfectly healthy before developing these health issues. * There are many other toxic substance exposures that have now been proven, over decades of research, to have delayed onset health issues (increased risk of health issues down the line): cigarettes, mercury, lead, etc. * Studies exist to show increased risks of chronic health issues in nations that have higher vitamin A intake, and taking accutane is basically like a nuclear bomb of a vitamin A derivative. * We know that Accutane can permanently stunt growth by closing epiphyseal plates * Accutane can damage structures and organs that create and regulate our hormones, which can cause long lasting and delayed onset health impacts (damage to testes/ovaries > long lasting damage to the production of sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen > long lasting/permanent damage to tissues and organs) Above are the existing body of research and understanding that lead us to believe that Accutane definitely can cause permanent health damage, and mechanistically we can understand why this may occur with a delayed effect (stem cell damage, DNA damage, changes in protein expression for critical connective tissue proteins). Lastly, here are 262 pages of (open source) scientific abstracts to studies showing isotretinoin as being incredibly toxic. [https://www.cjoint.com/doc/18\_07/HGplzsTbAyb\_ScientificStudiesOnIsotretinoin777.pdf](https://www.cjoint.com/doc/18_07/HGplzsTbAyb_ScientificStudiesOnIsotretinoin777.pdf?fbclid=IwAR1KmKPnfYkcnuKE K4WQCAXIZyOTcwEDV2yols7bRSVRqgYOLNkgE1MTUg)","My mother was given accutane (isotretenoin) while pregnant with me as treatment for leukemia. My mother and I were participants in a study sponsored by La Roche of the effects of isotretenoin in utero in 1991. I have spent my whole life with unexplained medical issues and doctors that don‚Äôt want to listen or doctors who don‚Äôt know anything about the drug or it‚Äôs effects. At 30 years old, I feel as though I live in the body of an 80 year old (and not the spry kind of 80). I am searching for any other people who may have been part of this trial or one like it. These studies led to the conclusion that accutane causes major birth defects. I took roaccutane (as it's labelled in UK) at the age of 13 for chronic acne. I had tried all other medications and creams available, but after 4 years of no luck and a lot of pain it was my only option. It worked; I have not had to worry a single day about acne ever again, and am now 30 years old, acne and scarring free. I did however randomly stop growing altogether at 13/14 years old, and am still the same height I was then, 5ft 2. I was always one of the shortest kids at school so was never expected to be more than about 5ft 7 as the doctors predicted. But 5ft 2 is incredibly short for a guy, especially considering my father is 6ft 1. His whole family are all around/just either side of average. My mother is 5ft 3 so around average height, but her whole family are around average also with the men usually ending up around 5ft 9. My younger brothers have both ended up at 5ft 6 and 5ft 9 but continued growing noticeably until they were around 20. Looking at my wider family, I would've expected me to end up between 5ft 5 and 5ft 8, but I never quite got there like everyone else. I don't want to put it down to roaccutane as it worked wonders for my skin and mental health at the time, but it seems the only plausible explanation that I would just randomly stop growing around the same time I had the course, and stay the same height as I was at 13 years old forever. ü§î It is very important to address and document the risks of taking accutane, since it is a commonly used drug. But i feel like the risks are highly exaggerated due to misinterpretation of the data. saying "" Accutane causes oxidative damage to the DNA and tissues of the body "" sounds scary, but most drugs damage dna and cells to a certain extent, even some commonly used food products. I've heard that accutane causes joint pain in most cases it just speeds up an underlying condition which had been developing prior to accutane use. Now, I have finished my accutane course 3 months ago and so far I couldn't be happier with the results. In my case, I've been diagnosed with depression and had severe social anxiety due to acne. It was ""crippling"" to a certain level. In my case, I'd rather choose to have the physical side effects describe above than to be mentally ""crippled"" and unable to live my life to the fullest. If not for accutane I would have been either hanging from a ceilling or locked up in a mental institution. My life has turned 180 degrees around. But this is my experience and what I had gathered from it. All people have different experiences, and this was mine. Does Accutane really lead to permanent ED and libedo problems? I‚Äôm glad I found this page‚Ä¶ a lot of the symptoms here ring a bell especially the stunted growth and fatigue! I took accutane nearly 13 years ago at 16. I was 5‚Äô11‚Äùat 15 years old (predicted to be 6‚Äô3‚Äù like my dad and all the males from my generation) and I started accutane at 16‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve not grown an inch since starting. For the longest time I blamed it on sleep deprivation (too many AP classes and extra curricular). Now I‚Äôm 29 and in decent health (testosterone is lower but within the standard range for my age group) but suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome (no joint pain fortunately). I blamed this on a bad case of mono in my Freshman year of college‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve tried improving my diet and regularly scheduled exercise but it ‚Äúbarely‚Äù helps me tolerate my day to day responsibilities as an engineer and father‚Ä¶ if anyone has suggestions on boosting natural energy let me know. My heart can‚Äôt handle my daily 5 hour energy shots much longer lol Does anyone know how to help ed from this drug mine came out of no where 7 months after stopping drug and then it improved a bit and got worse again I still get morning erections but they‚Äôre like 70 percent not full like before and when I do get a full erection it goes straight back down if I don‚Äôt keep touching it also weaker ejaculation anyone know how to improve this issue ? Please reply and give me a plan So is there anything we can do to reverse these side effects? I took accutane 5 6 years ago for 3 months on the lowest dose and I stopped suddenly so I didn‚Äôt finish my treatment completely. Can I still have post accutane side effects after all these years? [deleted] The ABSOLUTE worst part about Accutane is 1 that I never should've been prescribed it.. I didn't have that bad of acne.. At all.. It was just like oh here's this miracle drug, that u can't get pregnant on. Could have elevated liver levels and some other shit.. The superficial stuff tho that affected looks kills me.. I mean keeps me up at night.. I'm now 30 and took it when I was 17 and never got 1 cm wider than I was then. Everyone in my family has very broad shoulders and was super skinny/narrow in high school.. My hair thinned. I now have mild ulcerative colitis.. The fact that I'll NEVER be able to know how much better looking and how much better my life could've been if I never took it.. Broader shoulders so I don't still look like a boy at 30.. Thick hair. More supple less dry skin.. It's awful My teenage daughter was on Accutane from October 2020 March 2021. While it did clear up her acne, she has had debilitating back pain which began about a year after her last dose. We have been to multiple doctors, have done every blood test imaginable and no one can figure out the cause. It has to be the Accutane, I feel like this is obvious. My question is: How can I help her? Is this damage permanent? What are others doing to help with the pain? Are there any treatments available? Dry eye syndrome two years post accutane treatment. Hi everyone, I wanted to share my experience with taking Isotretinoin when I was 16 years old (in 2019). I took it for years. Ever since then, I have been suffering from joint/muscle pain, constant fatigue, and exhaustion that has become unbearable. My joints feel like they are rubbing against each other, and I have zero strength. I need heat for my joints and they feel stiff. Every step I take is painful, and it's affecting my daily life in a significant way. Despite seeing multiple rheumatologists and doctors, none of them have been able to find a solution or identify the root cause of my symptoms. I'd love to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience or has any advice on how to manage the symptoms. Thanks for listening. Has anyone here got fibromyalgia now and thinks it was caused by Accutane? Hello, I took this drug when I was 15. I remember playing basketball in 8th grade at the time. Half way through my knees were killing me, my dumbass derm suggested to up the dose and keep going. I later went on to play college football and tore 12 ligaments. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a limb that‚Äôs attached to my body. Truly it‚Äôs hell. My eyes fucking ruined. Everything ruined. I honestly don‚Äôt even like to think of all the stuff this drug did to me. Just don‚Äôt take it. Idc how bad ur acne is. Don‚Äôt take it. I just wanna kill myself everyday cause of the pain and hell I live in. But you look fine so people don‚Äôt care. Ill write a bigger post about it, if I don‚Äôt fucking put a 9mil threw my head before. The pain please make it go away. It‚Äôs so discomfortable in this body. Please. [deleted] I started Accutane treatment (In Brazil it's name is Roacutan), at 16y 17y, I used for 8 months, I want to know if this drug can really stop growth, in 100% of cases. Also I feel that my joints are shit until nowadays. I stopped to use Accutane 3 years ago I still have my back pain which I thought would go after after I stopped taking isotretinoin (October 2019). Turns out I got my acne back and my back pain is still there ‚òπÔ∏è Hypothetically most of the side effects are from the large dosage. I believe lower doses for longer period will eliminate most side effects [deleted] I have had bad cystic acne for a while. When I was 15, a dermatologist gave me a dose of isotretinoin (accutane) of 40mg per day if I'm correct. Thankfully, I was an irresponsible teenager and dropped out after not very long on the course. I'm 17 now, and a few months ago, I did a 1 month course on 20mg per day, and after around a 30 day break post that course, I've been on the same 20mg per day dosage for the past 3 weeks. I have read about your guys' experience with the horrible side effects, and the chapped lips are already killing me. I wanted to ask about whether I will have a chance after stopping this dosage, I don't want to experience these side effects and forsake my social and physical life. I was prescribed Accutane at the earliest age that was allowed at the time (2002), at 12 years old and was on it until I was 14, I believe, finishing my treatment at the highest available dose. To this day, my skin has remained remarkably clear and I have maybe a zit or two a year. I thought it was a miracle drug at the time. Now, I‚Äôm 34 years old, finishing treatment 20 years ago. I have cirrhosis of the liver and am severely anemic. I struggle waking up and tend to sleep for 12 16 hours at a time and I take at least one 1 2 hour nap a day. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar I, Major Depressive Disorder, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My ADHD is so unmanageable and that I have lost jobs time and time again. On top of that, I have an awful OCD, and have developed unshakeable ticks over the years and obsessive thoughts that have only worsened by already deteriorated mental state. I have had ED since I was 19, probably the worst time to have such an embarrassing disorder. No libido and things have just worsened as I‚Äôve gotten older. Viagra just barely works, but it also makes me nearly hallucinate, so I don‚Äôt exactly love taking it. I can attribute every chronic (and in some cases, potentially terminal) illness to Accutane. Admittedly, I didn‚Äôt do myself any favors regarding my cirrhosis, as I ruined my 20s by drinking 1L a vodka a day for probably 8 years. I did t know I had a compromised liver at the time, but it was the only thing that could make me feel normal. I‚Äôve been sober for 4 years now, which is‚Ä¶whatever. It isn‚Äôt as ‚Äúenlightening‚Äù as everyone claims it to be seeing as sobriety is ‚Äúin‚Äù now. Nothing wrong with that, but that‚Äôs another conversation. I no longer need a liver transplant, but I still have a much higher likelihood of getting liver cancer by the time I‚Äôm 50 or 60. All that to say, I think I may be happy for the first time in my life, but it‚Äôs been a fuck ton of work and maintenance to get to this point. Anyway, fuck Accutane, or whatever the fuck they‚Äôre calling it these days. I apologize for the extended comment here; this is the first time I‚Äôve shared all of this and it‚Äôs helped. i was on it for 9 months, 20mg. im scared and don't know how to reverse the damage Cant believe my derm let me do 40mg after i said i wanted to get it over with faster because side effects were so bad... she said joints hurting normal now its chronic. This info makes a lot of sense and hope can maybe counteract some with collagen or potential upregulating or get rich and take stem cells one day I took Accutane for 3 months and had to discontinue because of side effects. It‚Äôs been 2 months since I discontinued. I developed severe high pitched tinnitus that lasts 24/7 on 12th week, I‚Äôm not having my periods for the last 6 months, I have extreme back pain, I can‚Äôt focus, I‚Äôm having mood swings. I took accutane for 6 months and once I stopped started experiencing issues with my scalp. I still don't know what it is I've been shrugged off by every derm I've seen or given antibiotics that have made things worse...it's constantly painful and inflamed, I get pustules that are extremely painful...I am devastated I ever took this drug üò≠ Is Tretinoin as bad as Accutane? Shortly after finishing a 6 month course of accutane, I started getting chronic UTIs. I also got a handful of back to back BV infections. Vulvar pain and discomfort became a constant even after these infections but every time I would go back to the OB I was shocked to find that I did not have an infection. Years later and I have learned to manage the discomfort better but still suffer from chronic vulvar pain. The chronic UTIs went away (or so I thought) but when I became pregnant and my urine was being tested all the time I learned that I pretty much always have a low grade UTI. Usually with mild or no symptoms. Sometimes the culture would come back negative even though the dipstick came back positive. Years of consulting different OBs and Urologists and I have no diagnosis and no effective treatment for any of these problems. Spent last night in the ER with a severe UTI. My white blood count was elevated to the point they gave me a CT scan thinking it was a kidney infection. The thought literally just occurred to me that all of this started shortly after I took accutane. I thought I might be able to gain some insight from this group that I have so far been unable to obtain from doctors. Has anyone have any complications like this? Can anyone provide me with any source(s) to credit (or discredit) any of the bullet pointed claims made in the original post? Citing sources isn't the norm, but when you present a bulleted list of medical facts as being facts and proven by research, it's good practice to cite that research... even if it's Reddit. (I was encouraged by the one source linked but its a 404 error for me at the moment) The link to the abstracts is broken. Can you repost this? My godson has been suffering terribly since taking accutane 4 years ago and I am trying to figure out what to do and if there‚Äôs grounds for lawsuits. It‚Äôs an awful drug. My experience hasn‚Äôt physically been as extreme as a lot of the reports on here, thankfully. And my acne did clear up quite quickly. However I did notice a severe mood change when I started the medication which developed into further mental health problems down the road. I am assuming this is down to Roaccutane (UK) as there is no other logical trigger for it and it was a sudden change. I‚Äôm mostly fine, I guess. It‚Äôs just a battle. And if I were to have a word with my 14 year old self, I‚Äôd recommend just living with the acne and sacking off the drug treatment. Everyone who has ever taken accutane has been part of the trial. We were all lab rats. Many know exactly what you are talking about when you say you feel 50 years older, including myself. These are well known effects of the drug. Wow, feel deeply sorry for what has happened to you. I took it for acne, and I'm now bleeding sometimes when I go the bathroom. Very stupid decision I took when a teenager So sorry to hear this. I stopped growing in the middle of a growth spurt at 16. Looking back I‚Äôd never trade natural height to be clear of acne, let alone all the other side effects. So sorry It, albeit rare, has been proven to stop long bone growth and prematurely close growth plates.. I reached my height as I took it when I was 17, but everybody in my family is wide.. Broad shoulders big chest (wide chest).. Even girls.. I wear the smallest jacket size in my family and I was always one of the bigger kids growing up.. My shoulders or anything never got any bigger like most boys do into manhood.. I cannot believe the amount of negligence that goes into prescribing this drug 32, still dealing with mild acne, scars are there, not horrible but there. Just like the acne. Not horrible but there. Was considering accutane until I read these comments x I am glad you are ok man, but don‚Äôt underestimate the risks of accutane. It does cause profound oxidative damage to the DNA, and is a chemotherapeutic drug. You may not even be able to fully comprehend the extent of the damage this has the capacity to cause. I myself know many people who have been ok during the drug, a few months after the drug, but years later develop issues related to post retinoid syndrome that do not run in their family at all. Don‚Äôt get too high and mighty yet, my friend. You don‚Äôt know yet what kind of damage this could cause for you later on. You just don‚Äôt. Now, I believe that it only should be prescribed in extreme cases and doctors should tell the side effects beforehand. Also, what is really important, for doctors to prescribe this drug in lower doses over a longer period of time. This wil prevent some side effects, i think It‚Äôs been three years. Any health issues? Not being flippant. I was considering it myself. Yes absolutely. Being added to the label in the UK even. I don't know about that, after 3 years post treatment I have extremely high libido and could have sex for almost an hour with my girlfriend, and In the High School after 1 year post treatment I used to have a lot of spontaneous erection, indicating high testosterone levels. But I still think that Accutane could be dangerous, we don't have sure. Brother I would really appreciate an update on this Do you experience any health problems ? Why are you lying, you made another post later on if you click on your profile when you talk about your relationship with your husband and that you like sex Same here two years later and tests by derm show nothing hope my body can fix itself Try using Liver protection by New Roots‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..it helps detox the liver after Accutane and for some reason has been the only help for my dry eyes and dry mouth! 1 capsule a day and it‚Äôs vegan. It contains milk thistle and a few other natural herbs. Sharing what worked for me‚Ä¶but I still suffer with chronic fatigue:( YES! Thank you very much for the kind words? About time that reddit develops r/accutanedamage for those whose lives and bodies have been negatively affected or even shattered by the drug. Not 100% of cases, but it is not rare. I know people who took it as a teen and who did grow, and those whose growth plates were verifiably closed (open before the drug, suddenly closed at a premature age of 14,15,16, etc). It really depends. How bad do your joints feel these days? Stiff, painful, sore, achy? Do you feel like an older person? This can all be from accutane. So sorry you are hurt. I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you too :( Is the back pain better worse of the same as when you were on accutane? You're not alone. My pain is still there 35 years afterward. Try a totally raw diet made up mostly of fruit. See if you can commit to it for two months. Keep a journal and note down the improvements you see with your acne/pain. I started on 20mg and had very bad side effects, moved down to 10mg and it was much better but still had some side effects. Developed bad spine pain, frequent infections (mainly skin) etc. Have not taken it for around 4 months and still have the same health issues, I'm wondering now if it's all caused by the isotretinoin as doctors can't seem to figure out what else could be causing all my problems. Untrue there are people here suffering permanently from 10mg/day which is a ‚Äúlow‚Äù dose. If I were you I would stop. My acne came back and it is not worth all the risk. Its not as bad as immediately after its been 7 years or so but i suffer from balanoposthitis now too so sad this drug ruins your joints AND sex life and your eyes and mental health all i one... I have hope though there is things I can think of not mentioned here anyone feel free to message me if youve had improvement or curious of my ideas. Esp curious if anyone had balanoposthitis Lmao i was on 80mg, I'm honestly fucked. &#x200B; Anything helped you so far you could recommend? Anymore info ? Same question no it is not. Tretinoin is a topical form of vitamin A; not even in the same ballpark. It's safer\* YES i developped Sjogren symptoms, one year after just 9 days of use of Adapalene cream !!!! Sounds like you may have developed hormonally mediated vulvodynia. Aside from changes that come with aging (peri/menopause), this can be caused by meds that affects hormones. This is more commonly caused by birth control, however the acne med spironolactone is a known cause as well. I‚Äôm assuming accutane can affect the vulvar tissue similarly due to its effects on testosterone as well. You may benefit from seeking out a vulva or vulvodynia specialist. A prescribed estrogen/testosterone cream applied to the vulva may help improve your symptoms. The vulvovaginal tissues and urethra/bladder are filled with estrogen and testosterone receptors. When the tissues are deprived of one or both hormones it can cause thinning, inflammation and pain. This also puts you at increased for vaginal infections and uti or uti like symptoms. >Many know exactly what you are talking about when you say you feel 50 years older, including myself. myself included. I‚Äôve been off for 5 years and I‚Äôm still recovering. But I have found ways to reverse the cellular damage it does do. Starting 1/22/2022 I took 1 capsule everyday. 7 capsules then urgently stopped. 27 days later I took 1 capsule a day then stopped. I‚Äôm will not be a victim. What do I do? That's still an effect from accutane most likely, albeit a helpful one. I'm like that too, even into my 30's now. The big problems I've had from it are bipolar disorder related. i have thyroid imbalance and acne :( My comment was 2 years ago. This side effect did (thankfully) go away after a while. But yes I have always enjoyed sex which is why it was so impactful on my life when I noticed the huge changes in my body‚Äôs sexual response or lack of that coincided with my Accutane use. Was it diagnosed by a doctor? [deleted] My joints doesn't hurt, but I think that after Roacutan I noticed that my joints cracks a lot more, especially my back, I feel the necessity to crack everytime, also while using Accutane I felt pain on my lower back, like I was a old person, fortunately I don't have this pain anymore, but I feel like my joints cracks way more and my wrists hurt when I do push ups (the wrist It could be Accutane or because I played Tennis for a long time, so im not sure). Thanks for your feedback, really appreciate! Now I have 20y and I think that I grew up since I finished the treatment, I have something arround 177 178cm, after this pandemic I will look for a Orthopedic doctor to see if I was harmed by this drug. My back pain is definitely either better or the same as before but still bad enough to make me unable do activities like running. Yes it's definitely accutane caused. It screws up your immune system (frequent infections) and damages muscles/connective tissues leading to chronic pain. There is only one thing that will help : stop all drugs, do not ingest any kind of poison even OTC garbage like advil. Commit to a 100% raw diet of mostly fruit. Won't take more than a couple of months for you to feel better. Try it and watch what happens. With no evidence, it‚Äôs difficult to claim anything, thus why I said hypothetically. The higher the dose the more side effects [deleted] I will look into seeing a specialist, this is very helpful. Thanks so much! How? u/Bengalcatdad Question do you/anyone know if NAD+ is superior vs NMN supplement they seem to do the same thing (NMN is precursor to NAD+). Would appreciate any more information regarding this! I am 17 yo too Yup! By a pcp and a rheumatologist Thanks again for your support. Wouldn‚Äôt call myself a ‚Äúhero‚Äù, haha, but I do what I can and have successful shared the truth with many who as a result choose not to take accutane. So I consider that a success. Oh so you had pain when I accutane but not now anymore. How bad was your pain when you took it 1 10? The cracking afterwards is a sign of joint damage pretty common. Did you doctor warn you that long term joint damage is common? I am sorry to hear that :( how serious, on a scale or 1 10, is your back pain now and how serious was it when you took the drug? Agree with wheatman. Eating a raw diet of mostly fruit will not cure these effects. Period. this is horrifying advice It is not hypothetical and people whose bodies have been damaged by poisons don't need evidence poisons cause damage. They are living evidence. Only pharmaceutical companies require evidence but do everything they can to reject it because they are liable. This is not a science experiment. It is real people being hurt by real poison. There is no safe dose of poison. And chemo drugs rank as among the most toxic ever made. There is no way to create health with poison. Poison only damages health. In any amount. The way to create health in the body is by expelling toxins, not by ingesting them. Unfortunately doctors don't tell you that. Instead they send you away with an rx. Acooler does make a valid point simple, lower dose isn't as taxing on the body, don't need to get defense u/sobresal. I agree, I am sure if you took a low dose you are less likely to develop worse long term side effects. It just makes sense. I tested specific ANA: negative, but g√©n√©ral ANA were slightly positive. After i stopped tretinoins, i had some improvement for a few months, almost one year: but now my skin is dry like hell while it was too oily before, i still have dry eyes, and i have less saliva/dry mouth. All my problems started after Adapalene. There‚Äôs a supplement called Nad plus. It fixes your mitochondria which is what accutane messes up. I would rate it around 5, it was not pretty bad, but It was pretty annoying since I was felling like a old man, the pain was mostly when I bend my back to pick something in the ground. My doctor said that Accutane have just the normal side effects, but she didn't warned me about long term even permanent side effects. Yeah I mean I don't even mind if doctors prescribe the drug. Thing is I do have the rights to know the associated risks and side effects. My derm told me I'd only have dry eyes for a few days. Guess what? I had chronic headaches and acid reflux problems. I can be sure it's caused by Accutane because I've never had headaches or any stomach problems in my entire life before. Not even once and I'm not exaggerating. Now I'm with a weakened immune system. Before Accutane the worst I used to get was a flu every 2 years but after this I feel like I'm an old man [deleted] Actually? what is you're latest update on this? I've been off this dog shit drug for 6 years on 80mg and my body is that fatigue it ain't funny. I can't even fucking dry my hair without stopping a few times my joints feel like they are being dipped in lava and i physically just can't continue doing things for extent times, I can't put much pressure on my joints or i get worn out way to easy. Even stretching my body.. I nearly have to get in and take breaks from trying to do nice and easy stretches.. Shits a fucking joke honestly. I had fucked blood circulation, Insane head spins every time i get up, I've had fits related to this and nearly smashed my head on the ground. Everything honestly. Fuck this drug Just an example, Joints are destroyed.. Oh also don't move to quick i'll pull 18 fucking muscles in the process I've heard someone else recommend nad plus, what else do you recommend? I turned 17 birthday Jan 30th. Will this stunt my growth anywhere in my body and how do I stop that! This is causing me to panic. What do I do man fuck. Please help me bruh my mother doesn‚Äôt care about any of this and if i sense any effect I feel I‚Äôm going to lose myself physically and emotionally! Please help again everything you know man! I‚Äôll send you money online in exchange for details. How do you feel about the fact that she never bothered to consult with you about these risks? Or the risks that could develop after you stop taking it? Trets can trigger autoimmune diseases, so yes i think that's what happened to me. Thanks ! Hey just saw this. Ya I‚Äôve been off for 6 years now too and I‚Äôm still dealing with it. Nad plus helps a ton but red light therapy is my favorite. They have it at tanning salons. But ya blood circulation is one of the worst side effects from it. Red light therapy helps your blood circulation a ton. Look it up. Yo I took 30mg of accutane when I was 15 to 16(from november2020 to may 2022) 5months 20 30mg. How can I clear that shit from my system and which blood work i should do to see if there is accutane still Bro your 17 you will be fine your body can recover faster than someone that‚Äôs older like me. Sorry. But this made me smile. Not because if find your worrying amusing. But because I‚Äôm the same way. Very bad, she said thar Accutane is just a normal drug with light side effects, but unfortunately I can't do anything now, just accept, but thank you for support man, really appreciate. Alright I just freaked out on my mom lol she‚Äôs ordering Nad+ right now. Pray for me or something! Thank you man! Sure no worries. I can‚Äôt believe that she told you a normal drug with light side effects because my doctor said the same thing. He actually told me it is safer than tetracycline antibiotics, and had similar risks to Advil... I am honestly shocked that they all seem to believe this","AccutaneDamage"
