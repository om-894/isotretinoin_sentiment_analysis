zmtnnu,r/AccutaneDamaged Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneDamaged to chat with each other,Made this forum because /r/accutanedamage is restricted in posting and /r/accutane seems to only post/talk about happy stories. Looking for productive insightful content and stories. I took accutane 30mg then 60mg for 1 month and about 21 days. The dermatologist failed to explain the side effects well enough and negligently increased my dose to a significant level. I only stopped once I started with headaches and nosebleeds but by then it was too late. **Many side effects are late onset.** I weighed around 125lb at the time. Side effects at the time were dry skin headaches but nobody mentioned the permanent and long lasting side effects. My noticeable side effects as of now are: Permanently dry eyes (I can hear them when I blink a symptom of not enough moisture on the eyelids) Hair loss Tinnitus I may be developing an autoimmune disease as well. I have no idea how isotretinoin affected my insides or my brain. My skin is too dry for the wintertime now and it can hurt to use computer screens for long periods. I have deep regrets about what was ultimately a superficial concern and what is ultimately the failure of many doctors to warn against prescribing such a serious drug. My biggest success is that I did not take the full course through where I would shudder to imagine what my side effects would be then.

1ijf443,Should I Stop Taking Accutane (Isotretinoin) Due to Growth Concerns?,I’m a 17 year old male and I’ve been taking Accutane (isotretinoin) for about 3 months now at a dosage of 60mg per day. Recently I came across information suggesting that Accutane has a good chance of stunting growth which I hadn’t considered before. Now I’m wondering—should I stop taking it or is it too late since any potential effect on my growth might have already occurred? I’m concerned about whether continuing the treatment could further impact my height or if I should just finish the course. Has anyone else been in a similar situation or have any insight into how significant this risk actually is? Would stopping now make a difference or is the damage (if any) already done? Any advice would be appreciated!,You’re 17 gang. Sorry but your growth plates are closed man. Some people grow an extra inch maybe in their later teens up to like 21. But it’s pretty uncommon and a good amount of the time just delayed puberty. Your growth plates are closed by the time you’ve finished puberty.

1ij5bzk,Accutane/Isotretinoin caused tinnitus. One year later review,Short Version: I was prescribed isotretinoin for back acne. Got permanent tinnitus and significant hearing loss. Doctors failed to warn me about risks or side effects. It's a year later tinntius and hearing loss is still here. It's permanent. Long Version: It is my 1 year 'anniversary' since I developed tinnitus. I had a medium bad case of acne on my back which was very slowly being resolved by traditional topical treatments but my dematologist suggested that I take Isotretinonin otherwise known as Accutane in Canada and USA. The ONLY thing my demotologist warned me about was to stop treatment if I saw blood in my stool or was vomiting. Absolutely no other risks were mentioned. I started treatment in October 2023. At that time I had perfect hearing. The year prior I had a physical including a free hearing test. I had average low frequency hearing and astounding high frequency hearing. Despite being 36 I had hearing better than most teenagers. Within the first two weeks of taking the drug I had periods where my ears would ring for a few minutes. It was weird but I've had my ears ring before for short periods of time if I heard a loud noise or the atmospheric pressure suddenly changed so I thought nothing of it. By late November I started asking coworkers about an annoying high pitch scream I kept hearing. I'm used to hearing high pitch sounds others can't since I was a kid as I could hear CRT tv's electron guns and could hear the whine of power transformers. Since I work in an old industrial style building that was transformed into an office building I thought little of it. By December I started hearing the noise more often than not both at work and home and finally realized something was wrong but couldn't get a hold of my doctor to find out whether or not I should stop taking the medication as I assumed it was temporary. I stopped taking the medication by mid January. Initially the ringing in the ears started to go down but then abruptly became louder 2 weeks after stopping the medication. By then I found buried on page 4 in super tiny text a very long list of possible side effects and tinnitus was one of them. I spent February 2024 in agony as the high pitch scream was as loud as a busy street and wouldn't stop. I couldn't sleep for weeks and only could when passing out from exhaustion. I got a new hearing test and they confirmed my upper frequency hearing range crashed down where the higher the frequency the more deaf I was significantly. My hearing went from perfect to terrible in just those 4 months all because of that drug my dermatologist failed to properly warn me about the risks and frankly shouldn't have prescribed me in the first place as my acne problem was far far from dire. There was no good reason to switch to isotretinoin. It is a year later now February 2025. The tinnitus has only got a bit quieter roughly that of a room of talking people. It has been permanently present 24/7 ever since. Had multiple hearing tests since zero improvement. The only thing I could do was habituate to the awful sound which is incredibly difficult since I'm autistic and have limited ability to filter out stimulus like sound or touch. Please spread the word that isotretinoin should not be taken unless absolutely necessary and that ALL RISKS need to be clearly and carefully reviewed. My dematologist has been absolutely useless in this regard and should have probably warned me of all risks. The excuse that tinnitus is can 'uncommon' side effect is bullshit. If I knew and stopped back in October I might have kept my hearing and not had permanent tinnitus. For other victims out there I wish you the best. I tried everything but habituation was the only 'solution' I could find that did anything. This high pitch scream will be my companion for the rest of my life.,No comments
1i8sr9c,Accutane help,So I am thinking about going on accutane because I’ve had acne for a year and a half now and I’m just so done with everything I’m sure if you’re reading this you’ve been there too. Anyway I’m just wondering if accutane is the move. Everyone is so polarized on the subject of accutane people either swear by it saying it’s the best thing ever and others say it is the spawn of Satan and should be removed from the market. My question is is the only reason people get terrible side affects because they didn’t follow the rules that you’re supposed to while on accutane like sleep and no alocohol and maybe they should’ve aided their bodies in the processing of accutane like making sure to consume healthy foods and fish oil supplements? Does that make sense? Sorry I’m rambling accutane seems so appealing but them I’m reminded that some people are permanently messed up over it.,I’m doing all of those things and 3 weeks in I’m experiencing side effects. The dryness is crazy. I’m only 20mg a day also. It’s a lot more intense than thought but everyone is different.
