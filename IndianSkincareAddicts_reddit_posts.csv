This ordeal left me with a lot of PIH and PIE. So I started a night time routine for the marks and scars. At night I use Rejuglow Cleanser Kojic Acid Serum (finished it a couple days back so no longer using it but it still was part of the routine until recently) Aloe Vera Gel (my skin feels the best when I use this) Aziderm 10 % gel But since I have started using my cleanser when I rub or apply something on my skin afterwards it feels like dead skin is peeling off my face (kind of like when you scrub dead skin off your body when we bath in hot water) I don't understand why it is happening ? My skin is perfectly alright otherwise. I just gently dust it off and continue with my routine. I would appreciate some input on this matter. Idk if it's because of the aziderm or cleanser. Is it because the skin isn't hydrated enough?

I wanted to use niacinamide since that targets all these concerns. I bought The Ordinary serum first and then a sunscreen with niacinamide in it and I noticed that it made me breakout like crazy both times. So I stopped using any products with niacinamide in them. I wanted to ask whether there are any alternatives for niacinamide that I can use instead. My skin type is combination kind of oily as hell in summer and dry af in winter. But overall it leans more towards oily.

It can lead to a fuck ton of skin problems that'll make your current issues look tiny in proportion. Since you're a teen I'd say stop using Hydroquinone immediately and go to a derm.

1iwd6ym,Before and after (3 months apart),26 F skin type normal The left pic is from dec 2024 and present pic is taken on feb 2025. Switched to a minimal skin care regime and got rid of serum and other chemical products I was using. Starting using a mild face wash essence by Melita ( game changer worked as a replacement for serum and toner) the formulation was mild and gentle which really worked for my already sensitive skin (photo attached on the second slide) and I paired it with cetaphil moisturiser from the drugstore. It took a lot of trail and error for me to find something that really worked for me and I also had to make better lifestyle choices which eventually worked for me hand in hand. Apart from using the essence for hydration i also drank almost 2L of water daily and cut down sugar.,Is the essence similar to snail mucin?

I have tried several products and nothing showed any significant results. Currently using drugstore ointment suggested by my derma and it’s breaking me out so I stopped
1iwcztl,Alternative to this beautiful sunscreen,I am having a dry skin but still I prefer liquid light weight sunscreen as I don't want to look oily. Minimalist liquid sunscreen is my favorite sunscreen as it is photostable too but as summers are coming it making my skin look more oily. Is there any good light weight liquid sunscreen which is alternative to Minimalist. It should be photostable as don't reapply sunscreen much,Try Suganda sunscreen.
