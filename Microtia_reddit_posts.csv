1it4zlo,Magnet surgery,I'm 15 born with bilateral microtia. When I was 10 my parents thought it would be a good idea for me to have the magnetic implants so that I wouldn't have to wear my softband. It's been almost 6 years since this surgery and I am unable to wear the magnets without feeling discomfort and pain. Even if I wear a lower strength magnet it will hurt just as much as the highest strength one. Has anyone else had this surgery? If so do you feel comfortable wearing it? I still wear my soft bands and I wish I never had these magnets as they bring no benefit to me.,Hi! I also have bilateral microtia! Which hearing aid do you have specifically? I used to have the BAHA magnets but they would constantly get infected or irritated with pain even when I used the soft pads they provide to cushion the magnet but after I switched to OSIA it has improved my life drastically since I had no pain from irritation and haven’t got an infection and it’s been 3 years so far.

The doctor told us to get that magnet implants for an ear prothesis. Would you say it‘s not good?

I had to have another surgery to replace the magnet with the post which works so much better.

I still wear my soft bands and I wish I never had these magnets as they bring no benefit to me.,I had unilateral magnet surgery 4 years ago. Sometimes I have some irritation but that’s generally if the soft pad is wearing thin or I’ve been wearing my BAHA for long periods of time. Overall I get on pretty well with it. My doctor recommended having two soft pads on if you’re still getting irritation maybe try that?

I've worn the soft band my whole life and I experienced the exact same thing with the BAHA magnets. I'm looking into the abutment surgery (which is what I originally wanted). I'll look into the OSIA. Thank you so much for sharing your experience:)

Personally I think that doing the surgery at a younger age would be better as your son would have more time to get used to them. Hopefully my experience with the magnets isn't shared with others.

1imtehv,My daughter was born with no ear tunnel on the right ear. The other ear looks fine. Doc’s are still doing tests and haven’t said anything yet. Does anyone know or have been through this? What are the possible solutions? I’m super worried please help!,,Don't worry. All is gunna be fine. My little boy was born this way too. He's now almost 7 and thriving. Living a completely normal and wonderful life. He just has one little ear and one giant heart. His brother and sister has never even wondered about his ear. Just keep calm and trust God has a perfect plan. There's a great support group called the ear community. They have an instagram. *

What are the possible solutions? I’m super worried please help!,,Hey. Evwrything is going to be fine. Your baby will probably need a hearing test called BERA. This test will tell is the cochlea is procesing sound properly. Depending on the result your baby may be eligeble to use a bone conducting hearing device. In our case my baby has microtia atresia and also his jaw is affected. A lot of tests were performed to rule out any other mal formation like in the heart brain kidney bones. Everything looks fine. We are also being seen by a geneticist and have already had a normal kariotype and micro array. And for peace of mind we saw a neurologist. He is fine and developing great. In the future he will need surgery in is jaw and if he wishes an ear reconstruction (but just for aestetics).

Everyone we have talked to says that one ear of hearing is all that is needed for normal language development. My son likes his long blonde hair so most people don’t even know about his microtia. Curveballs like this are hard mourn the change what difference from what you imagined but know life should all end up working out.

It was shocking at first and I got sad a lot thinking about how her life will be affected but at 28 months she’s thriving and ahead of the curve with her speech. Take it one day at a time. Don’t give in to despair.

We have the BAHA but we never use it as he hears so well with his left ear. You could never know he has no canal in the left one. Maybe thinking of getting him a surgery later in life to open the ear canal of the right ear. They said everything is intact and it’s only the canal missing. It shall be well

I'm 45 and my biggest disability has been that I can't tell which smoke detector is low on batteries. I don't have good directional hearing but I've adapted perfectly well. When I walk with friends I make sure they are to the left of me and I can't wear ear pods so I usually use over the head headphones. I've never heard stereo music but don't know what I'm missing in that area so I appreciate other things instead. As a kid it was a novelty to point out to friends. And a great way to win points in ""two truths and a lie""."

Growing up until about age 8 I would use a hearing aid. Then I got an atresia repair surgery allowing me to have an ear canal in that left ear. I didn’t wear a hearing aid after that. I still have a hearing loss but it is better than before the surgery! I’ve lived a totally normal life. I was bullied when I was younger for wearing a hearing aid and the shape of my ear but it just made me have thicker skin I guess! I see my ENT doctor who preformed my surgery every year to get my ear checked out and a hearing test done.

1if2ijc,programs that help w surgery,Hello everyone I have a babyboy named Remy who’s four months old he was born with unilateral microtia and atresia in his left ear. I don’t ever want to push any surgery on him but I can’t help and think about the day he might ask for it. I’m a sahm and my husband doesn’t make a ton of money I was wondering if there’s any programs or any kind of help that would pay for the surgery. We have health insurance but I’m sure they won’t cover due to it being a cosmetic thing. Also any recommendations on drs? I was told at his ent appt that most drs don’t do the canal surgery because it can cause alot of infections. Thank you for any input!,"They should cover it. It's not cosmetic he's missing a vital organ. I would ask that you wait until they're old enough to enthusiastically consent to the surgery. My outer ear (failed attempt at age 5 ""successful"" at age 12) is only for others to feel more comfortable has been miserable to recover from and taught me from a young age that I needed to be fixed."

I have already been offered to have reconstruction surgery I recently only had the osia done out of necessity. But I have no desire to reconstruct it the fewer procedures the better especially as it is a complicated surgery. The best thing you can do is create a reserve so that in the future he can think about whether to carry out the procedure or not.
1iekan4,Parents of children with microtia when did they start becoming aware of their difference and how did you explain their difference to them?,Hi everyone! My son is almost 3 months old born with unilateral microtia/atresia in his right ear. So far he's been such an awesome baby babbling and smiling so much and we're grateful he's a beautiful healthy boy. I'm wondering though at what age did your child realize their ear or ears were different? I know the time will come to explain what microtia is to him and I just hope he doesn't become too self conscious about it. Also would love to hear how you all went about explaining it to your children and how they took it.,I have unilateral microtia atresia in my left ear and my parents never put any pressure on me to have it “fixed” through surgery. They always told me it’s what made me special. I have an early memory of asking my mom when my ear would grow. My mom says it was very hard for her because she didn’t want me to feel different but I am different and that’s ok. I’m 31 now and I embrace it never had surgery and don’t use any hearing aids. It’s just part of me. So I don’t have any advice from a parent’s standpoint but my family just making me feel normal by not making my difference feel like a big deal really helped my confidence. Of course other kids will be mean but my parents taught me to celebrate differences which helped me deal with bullies.

I have microtia and it has never bothered me but it bothers other people explain to him that it will be difficult and don't compare yourself to others otherwise he will adapt. The first years of school are easy for us I had a very welcoming class I wish the same! Hugs mom and dad good health and happiness! Don't worry about that!

I know the time will come to explain what microtia is to him and I just hope he doesn't become too self conscious about it. Also would love to hear how you all went about explaining it to your children and how they took it.,As a parent I never personally liked the “oh you’re special” approach. I think that actually highlights the difference they have and makes it stand out. In my opinion microtia doesn’t defined them. They can stand out and be special for some many other awesome things. My kid is almost 5 now and he is starting to ask why he has a hearing aid when others in his class don’t. We have honest talks and I just tell him he was born that way. I tend to bring up glasses during our conversation because they are more common. Some kids were born with eyes that need help to see better and they need the hearing aid to hear better. Another example is how our hair color is different. People are just different. No better or worse or special or boring. Everyone is just their own really cool individual. We have also had strangers come up to us to ask about his headband / BAHA. If you haven’t been told this will happen it will and it’s ok. My wife and I decided to be open and help people understand. I never heard about Microtia until kiddo was born. I think they are asking out of genuine curiosity so I believe it’s a good opportunity to help them learn about something new. Fun story I’ve always checked both ears when I ever need to check or clean his one because that’s what I would do with my other kids. It’s fun and funny when he checks me and has to “remind” me that there “isn’t a hole in that one” with a sigh and an “oh silly dad” tone. He has also told Drs if we happen to see one that isn’t his normal one that there is no need to check that ear when they are moving fast and just going through their normal routine. It’s really cool to see him advocating for himself at this young of an age. Raise ‘em like you imagined raising kids would be like and you won’t know the difference. At least that’s what I’m trying to do I guess I’ll find out when they are an adult if it was the right move.

I think my mom meant well but it definitely gave me a complex.

I’m trying to raise our daughter the same way and try to model for our oldest how to answer questions or frankly stupid comments from people. I don’t see anything “wrong” with her difference and I don’t see any reason to hide it. I do worry she will have a different attitude due to bullying or what not. I know kids can be so mean. Honestly at the end of the day I’m hoping my daughter grows up to be proud of who she is as a whole person and won’t shy away from showing off her ear

We will always support him.

It did hurt my feelings sometimes but once I explained to them that I was just born that way they would leave me alone. My face also droops to one side a little bit and it does hurt my confidence when I see people noticing it but I’ve also met so many wonderful people who don’t make me feel any different.

1idranb,New parent here.,Our son was recently born with Microtia (self assessed) we haven’t gone through ENT yet many things happened during my wife’s birth so we plan to take it slow and get it done one by one. We first plan to secure that our son’s hydronephrosis didn’t progress and next is his ears. His right ear is really different hence the microtia while left ear seems a normal ear without hole but we can see there’s a slight dip and we are hoping that his ear canal was developed. But my main concern is: What are the things you consider in newborn with this condition growing up? Is it normal that they would cry more often than babies with fine ears? Do they naturally will have problem burping? Or what are the common things that baby with this condition will experience?,"Welcome to the group. My son is 4 years old and his left ear has Grade 2 Microtia with a closed ear canal. His right ear is normal. We went through the same process you did. We confirmed his kidneys were fine and then confirmed that his inner ear is fine too. Then after doing a lot of research and reading through this sub we determined to get a hearing aid and revaluate when he's old enough to decide what he wants to do with his ear. He never had problems with burping and was overall a perfectly normal baby. He is now a thriving toddler who started riding his bike when he was 3 just to give you a sense. He's hilarious too. Great sense of humor. As a parent I had similar questions that you have and had appointments lined up to see all kinds of specialists but your child will be completely fine. We don't treat him any differently. He talks up a storm. He also never talks about not being able to hear something. When I ask if music in the car or a movie is too quiet he says he hears fine. At playgrounds he's able to hear when I call for him perfectly well. Sometimes he'll refer to his ear as his ""small ear."" That's about it. Happy to answer any other questions you may have."
1idranb,New parent here.,Our son was recently born with Microtia (self assessed) we haven’t gone through ENT yet many things happened during my wife’s birth so we plan to take it slow and get it done one by one. We first plan to secure that our son’s hydronephrosis didn’t progress and next is his ears. His right ear is really different hence the microtia while left ear seems a normal ear without hole but we can see there’s a slight dip and we are hoping that his ear canal was developed. But my main concern is: What are the things you consider in newborn with this condition growing up? Is it normal that they would cry more often than babies with fine ears? Do they naturally will have problem burping? Or what are the common things that baby with this condition will experience?,My second daughter is 8months born with grade 3 microtia. Each baby is entirely different and I found my first to be so much more difficult mostly because the adjustment of having my own baby was overwhelming. My daughter with microtia also has hemifacial mircosomia and we had issues early on with breastfeeding because she wasn’t able to create enough suction. It has gotten better as she has gotten older and stronger. Both my girls were very difficult to burp. And I wouldn’t say my daughter with microtia cried anymore than any other baby. I would say try get imaging done on heart and kidneys as well as setting up work with an audiologist.

Absolutely nothing different about his growth or condition than his older brother of 8. The only thing he has a small issue is would be directional hearing. I'll call him from on side of a playground and he has to scan multiple angles to find me. Only downside we have experienced. Totally normal little boy happy and loves worship music.
