"New Additions to Low Efforts; ""SHOULD I GO ON ACCUTANE?""","Please remember, this is Reddit, and we are strangers.  

Posts asking if one should start Accutane without a picture of the user's skin and/or a brief summary of one's acne struggles will be removed.

No one here is qualified to assess you for Accutane, and you should first see a doctor or dermatologist to assess your condition.",Thankkkk yooouuu. So annoying!! Only a derm will be able to tell you if it is a good option.
Do not solicit medical advice,"First and foremost a happy new year to everyone.

With the new year, we will be much stricter on the do not solicit medical advice rule.

We know many people going ""Just looking for experiences (:"" are looking to circumvent doctor's advice. It is a thinly veiled attempt at ""if he or she did it, I can too.""

Everyone is different and has a different medical history, so you should always first and foremost consult your doctor or derm.  

Things that generally constitute medical advice include:

\- Anything that could break your skin, including extractions, lasers, waxing, etc.

\- Any use of PRESCRIPTION medications(oral or topical)

\- Surgery related(HELLO YOU REALLY WANT A STRANGER TO ADVISE YOU ON SURGERY?)

\- Starting and/or stopping a MEDICATION.  Your accutane is prescribed by a doctor.  If you have conerns about taking or ceasing a medication, you should consult a medical professional(ie doctor or pharmacist) and not the internet.

\- IS THIS DOSE TOO HIGH OR LOW?  

\- Interpreting of lab/test results.  This is clearly specialized knowledge, and if you would not consult a hobo about your lab results, you most clearly should not consult Reddit.

\- Oh, my doctor said not to worry, but... - Reddit in most situations should not supercede your doctor's medical advice.

  
Ultimately, it will always be at the mod's discretion, and we were not born yesterday.  You would surprised at how many crazy posts have had to be removed.",
Grateful for Accutane,"Pictures aren’t the best quality, but Accutane changed my life. I’m currently 4 months into a 6-month cycle of 80 mg/day ","That’s great progress. Did you get any scarring? Good progress, so proud of you"
