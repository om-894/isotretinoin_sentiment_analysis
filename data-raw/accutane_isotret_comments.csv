Posts and comments not following the rules will immediately be removed!

Have you tried using the search bar?  
Many questions are asked daily, and your question may have already 
been answered!  
If so, your post will be subject to deletion.

Please refer to the following commonly discussed 
topics:

1) No one can predict whether or not you will purge! 
Statistically, most people DO NOT purge.  
That is what the science and medical literature says.

2) No one can predict how long your purge will last 
nor when it could start. 
Be patient, the purge can be tough but so many people have gotten through it - 
you can too!

3)  Any questions related about dosage MUST include DOSE and WEIGHT(lbs or kg).  
Otherwise, that is considered LOW EFFORT and will subsequently be REMOVED.   

4)  Most people DO NOT relapse when Accutane is taken until cumulative dosage is reached.

5) HOWEVER, cumulative dosage is a guideline.  
Everyone is different.  Some may need more Accutane, and others may need less.  Your dermatologist 
evaluates you as an individual.  
This also applies to your prescription.  Everyone is different, so no comparing of doses or asking why your dose is low or high.
If you do not trust your dermatologist, you should find a different one.

6) When in doubt, please consult a medical 
professional(dermatologist, doctor, pharmacist).  
DO NOT solicit medical advice from this subreddit.  
Remember Reddit is a bunch of strangers on the internet.

I also take fish oil and cod liver oil daily, which was helpful for joint pain from being in the gym six times a week.

I also had to do less training but harder training. While on accutane I can't do a lot of training volume, doing less volume but higher intensity was more effective and my body tolerates it better. 

For dry eyes, I use preservative-free, oil-based eye drops to keep them hydrated and comfortable.

I also had to completely switch my skincare routine to accommodate dry skin. I went from using products tailored for oily skin to exclusively using ones intended for dry skin. And I put moisturizer from head to toe after every shower.",11_1_1

Ik ben nu in m'n tweede maand bezig en over het algemeen gaat het erg goed. Heb de eerste maand elke dag 20mg ingenomen en toen dat goed ging moest ik vanaf de tweede maand 40mg innemen.,21

Treatment round 1: 6 months/- 40,60,60,60,60,60
After round 1 my acne came back pretty quickly. Like 5 months after starting. 




Treatment round 2: 7 months 40,80,80,80,80,80,80,8
After this round o stayed pretty clear for 2.5 years. My skin texture all over my body has improved a lot. No back acne or bum acne still. Just facial acne. Not nearly as bad, so Im hoping this is the last round/treatment Ill ever need.





Post Accutane after my 3 round of treatment. (August 2023) Ill maintain with Spirolactone. My skin hates topic retinoids, otherwise I would use that.",1_1
