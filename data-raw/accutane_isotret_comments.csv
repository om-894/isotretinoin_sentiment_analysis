In the beginning like month one my skin was very dry, but now my skin is less dry because I only wash my face once a day because I noticed that when I was doing it twice a day my skin would get soooo dry it would burn after washing. I dont wear any makeup just cerve tub moisturizer! My lips are still dry and I have to reapply some type of moisturizer every 10 minutes I feel =5=Â« I havent found a lip product that helps more than the other so I cant recommend the best one because theyve all been the same for me. I notice my eyes are really dry after wearing contacts all day, but that feeling goes away after a few minutes of taking them out. Personally I havent burned from the sun while on accutane, but I was in the sun a lot before the medicine. My hair is pretty dry, but not annoyingly I just simply wash it once a week now which is nice! My body gets pretty dry, but daily lotion cures it. I havent had any bad psychological issues at all I feel totally fine thank goodness! I have had a cocktail twice since being on the medicine and I felt fine maybe a little like oh wow I feel slightly tipsy, but I wasnt like falling over after one drink hahah. All of my acne is basically gone and I am just dealing with acne scars and hyperpigmentation which hopefully goes away =O<Ã» the only negative thing is that my libido is low and Im dry down there, but luckily it hasnt been a total mood killer just something ive noticed. Over all my experience has been great so far just dry!",9
