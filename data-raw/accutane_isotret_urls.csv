2023-12-16,1702741542,"Hair loss: Doc said it was TE, turned out to be diffuse thinning baldness.","Hello all,

Just sharing my experience taking accutane. I shed hair heavily a month after starting and the doctors said it was temporary; telogen effluvium. I trusted them and carried on. I took a biotin pill with every isotretinoin pill, 40mg for 6 months. I did not go up to 80 mg for this reason (I did briefly but went back down) Im a male in my late 20s.

 It was still shedding rapidly 6 months after completing the course. Doc said to wait till the year ends to reassess. I read many posts in this subreddit, some saying be patient and it really does stop at 10 months. And I also saw many others (mostly from men) where it triggered baldness.

I did this, I was in denial about the reality of my situation at this time. My hair got visibly worse, very diffuse, temples receded in the identifiable pattern. I started taking finasteride. The shedding stopped within a week. It was androgenic alopecia. I believe this was triggered or ""fast forwarded"" by accutane, but who can say. Baldness does not run in either side of my family.

I wanted to take accutane to cure my mild persistent acne once and for all, so I didn't have to take the topical for life. I would go back if I could!

I know Accutane works for most people, it's unfortunate I've become a statistic. My advice is to see a trichologist if you are concerned about your shedding, they can tell if it really is TE or AGA. 

The rapid nature of it made it very hard to distinguish from telogen effluvium, which is temporary. Regular baldness takes years to change my hair like it has.

Anyone have a similar experience? What have you done about it?

Edit 4 months later: if you are reading this, please do not resort to using finasteride/ propecia. It had an extremely negative effect on me, especially after quitting. I quit due to low libido and inability to get drunk. I took it for 4 months. 

A month after quitting i have had a wave of uncontrollable anxiety come from nowhere. I have read that it is because finasteride can create resistance to allopreganolone in your GABA receptors. This hormones alleviates anxiety. This is the worst I've ever felt, and it could be hard to treat.

I think being on accutane also creates confounding factors if you go on propecia,  it's not worth it. I thought losing my hair was Losing my identity, this is the real thing.

If you are already on it and want to quit, maybe taper the dose, and do not drink alcohol during this time. I was improving from finasteride for around a month, then crashed. So maybe taper off for longer than that, halving the dosage size a few times. Do it under doctor supervision. And keep an especially healthy lifestyle.

Edit 2: the anxiety has subsided after a couple more days, but it was not an enjoyable ride whatsoever.

2020-01-10,1578623340,Going to be starting my 4th round...,"I am 64 (male), had my first round around age 30 (actually, my first round was two, almost consecutive, rounds. First, 5 months at 40mg a day, then 3 months later, the same dermatologist - Dr Gary Peck, the doc who discovered accutane for cystic acne - had me also take 80mg a day for 4 or 5? months).

My second round was at age 45, I think. Same doctor. 40mg a day for 5 months.

My third at age 56. Different doctor. 40mg a day for 4 months.

Today, I went to a new dermatologist (last year, I moved from USA to Colombia, South America), and he agreed another round is in order. He gave me a 'prescription' to get my lipids/cholesterol tested, and I go back to him in a week.

First round, I mostly had ""exploding cysts"". Small lumps under my skin that would sometimes become HUGE within 1 day. Huge, like a very large boil. So huge, that the head of dermatology at George Washington University in Washington DC asked me if I would be willing to come and visit him the next time I had one. I did, he 'showed my zit off' to 3 or 4 med students and a couple other doctors.

2nd, 3rd, and now 4th rounds, I had/have regular old pimples (the kind that pop easily), no more exploding cysts, and seborrheic dermatitis on my scalp (shampoos don't help me. The acne and red bumps on my head can get very gross/nasty), and rosacea.

The first 3-4-5 years after I do a round of accutane/isotretinoin, my skin is perfect. Then, gradually, it gets worse again.

Before my round at age 30 (or thereabouts), I took 100mg of doxycycline everyday, for 6 or 7 years.

2021-11-13,1636804465,A tip for those in the UK with eye side-effects,"Check out the [Minor Eye Conditions Service (MECS)](https://primaryeyecare.co.uk/services/minor-eye-conditions-service/) if you develop nasty eye symptoms.

At about the 6 month mark on isotretinoin my eyes became incredibly dry, pretty much overnight. I started getting a bit of double vision and could barely keep my eyes open, making me panic as I'm in my 30s and have never had a problem with my eyes in my entire life.

I struggled to work (desk job) and even with Systane eyedrops and hot compresses it was unbearable. I contacted my dermatology department (I've had different derms every appointment) and the head nurse said to decrease the dose and get back in touch in a month's time. I said waiting a month wouldn't be possible given the severity of the symptoms and so she said she'd arrange an appointment for me. Fast-forward a few days and I've heard nothing back so I give them another call. This time a different nurse picks up and immediately recommends I find a MECS practice.

I found an affiliated optometrist on the website and they saw me within 24 hours. They did a full check-up including a dry eye test (by putting ink in my tears) and said that they were in a bad state - I was blinking 4 times more than average. I've been given some much more effective eye meds and a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. Not only have my eyes massively improved but I'm so much less stressed now I'm being monitored by an expert (who said, by the way, he's dealt with accutane users before and symptoms do go away eventually).

I'm sharing this in case your experience is or will be anything like mine. Had I known about MECS, I would have received treatment much sooner and not gone through 2 weeks of absolute misery.

Fast-forward a few days and I've heard nothing back so I give them another call. This time a different nurse picks up and immediately recommends I find a MECS practice.

I found an affiliated optometrist on the website and they saw me within 24 hours. They did a full check-up including a dry eye test (by putting ink in my tears) and said that they were in a bad state - I was blinking 4 times more than average. I've been given some much more effective eye meds and a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks. Not only have my eyes massively improved but I'm so much less stressed now I'm being monitored by an expert (who said, by the way, he's dealt with accutane users before and symptoms do go away eventually).

I'm sharing this in case your experience is or will be anything like mine. Had I known about MECS, I would have received treatment much sooner and not gone through 2 weeks of absolute misery. Good luck with your accutane journey!"

I think the biggest issue with Accutane, is that there are limited collective resources to answer anything and everything about the drug.

2020-11-26,1606356190,Should I go on accutane? ABSOLUTELY. My experience taking 20mg daily,"I am a 24 year old male. Growing up I had moderate cystic acne, nothing as severe as most accutane patients I have seen. I would only break out in a couple of spots but mostly wanted to go on accutane to get rid of the painful pimple nuisance. 

I was prescribed a 40mg dose of accutane when I was 15 years old but only endured about a month because I became extremely depressed. Now, if this depression came from the pills themself, or from the heartbreak I went through simultaneously, I do not know lmao. But, it was enough for me to want to top the pills immediately. I am still saddened looking back as she is literally a model now, insanely thick blah blah blah.. that most likely fueled my sadness not the actual accutane. Aside from dwelling on my dream girl that kicked me to the curb, I know I was only 15 but this pain runs deep, dont judge me :/... 

Anyways flash forward to my 24 year old self, I planned to give accutane another shot. My dermatologist let me know that I can take half the usual dosage(20mg) for twice as long as the normal dosage(40mg). At 40mg I was looking at roughly 6 months, or with 20mg I would double that time frame. The takeaway here is that neither method is superior as he let me know that whichever dosage I chose, the end result would be the same. I have now been taking a daily 20mg pill for a little over a year and have clear skin without any serious side effects. The first couple months I had an itchy scalp which was annoying but bearable. Another side effect I have is dryer than usual skin, but it is not irritating at all just looks ashy and feels dry. Also, you are more prone to sunburn, but I live in Cali and still made plenty of beach trips, where I am swimming for the entirety of it and dealt with the burns and maybe slight pealing. Not a big deal.

I would recommend to anyone thinking of trying accutane to try this half dosage(20mg of Claravis Isotretinoin capsules to be exact) and to not be worried about the 100+ side effects listed on the package. These side effects were actually a big worry for me as I had the poor experience many years ago, but after a couple months on it, you realize these side effects are non existent(for me at least I dont want to be insensitive) or minimal, power through it for a year and live the rest of your days acne free.

I've come to hate the word ""zit."" ""Pimple"" too for that matter. I can actually feel my confidence shattering when I hear an advertisement for a skincare product that uses a phrase like ""zap those zits."" I don't have zits. I listen to my friends bemoan their pimples and I have to physically bite my tongue. I don't have pimples. These words are childish, almost cute. For most people they evoke memories of junior high dances, the sharp smell of astringent in the locker room, or feelings of inconvenience and embarrassment. These words are not ""acne."" Acne is not a cute word. There are no advertisements in Cosmopolitan for products that ""zap"" severe, nodulocystic acne. Acne is not embarrassing, it's devastating.
 
At my skin's worst, I couldn't touch my face or smile without being in pain. I would wake up to blood on my pillow case and look in the mirror in the morning and cry. Plans with friends were cancelled and I would come up with any excuse to work from home. I would do my best to cover it with makeup but some days that just wasn't possible. Strangers would look at my face and I could tell that they weren't looking at me. They weren't seeing me, just my acne. And when I could cover it, most of it, with foundation, I would have to reconcile that with the fact that we live in a society that loves to shame women for wearing makeup. We're constantly bombarded with messages like ""take her swimming on the first date"" or phrases like ""cake face."" People, men usually, seem to think its a compliment or some kind of virtue signal to say that they prefer a woman without makeup. We applaud celebrities or influencers when they post their #NoMakeupSelfie's, with not a blemish in sight, and we call that real. Of course, we never talk about the fact that natural is only beautiful when you have naturally beautiful skin. Public figures never mention the expensive facials, dermatologists, or even plastic surgery that gave them that selfie. But then, we shame women for that too.
 
From the age of 14 acne has been a part of my life. I saw my first dermatologist a year later who prescribed a slew of topicals, all of which failed to do much of anything except give me some pretty nasty side effects. Topicals are what I like to call J.V. acne treatment. I got bumped up to Varsity when we moved to antibiotics and birth control. We called a foul on Minocycline after my first dose almost sent me into anaphylactic shock. But, by senior year of high school we had assembled a solid team of birth control, Amoxicillin and Differin. This was back when Differing was not available OTC. While the acne was mostly under control, it was not gone. There was always a breakout I was working to conceal and fresh scars I was attempting to fade. This continued into college where I made some of the most incredible friends who, coincidentally, had the most incredible skin. I would battle with the green eyed monster every Spring Break or trip to the lake where they never had to plan how they would be able to reapply their foundation after a swim. They could fall asleep after a night out without washing their face and still wake up the next day with a perfect complexion. Tumbling out of bed for their *7:30am, lectures without a touch of concealer, they could make comments like, ""I just don't have the time for makeup."" They're the kind of girls who could go the rest of their lives without it and still be the most beautiful people in any room. I love my friends, and every single of one of them is just as beautiful at heart. They never made me feel ""fake"" or vain for bringing half my cosmetic bag in my purse to parties. When they sat next to me in the mirror as I put on layers of foundation they complimented my technique and complained about never knowing how to apply it. I knew it wasn't their lack of expertise that kept them from putting on a full face of makeup. They simply didn't need it.
 
I mention these memories with my friends because as wonderful as they are, as compassionate and caring as they may be, they don't understand what it's like to have skin like mine. If there's any wisdom I can impart upon the dermally blessed it would be this: stop giving your friends with acne advice. Even with the best intentions, its infuriating. I can promise you, if they have acne like mine (severe nodulocystic acne, in case you forgot) they have spent countless hours and sleepless nights searching for any and everything to cure it. They have tried the dairy free diets, the baking soda face masks, and my personal favorite, drinking more water. If they're a fellow cyster they've also tried Spironolactone. Moreover, acne in your adult life is largely determined by genetics which is why your boyfriend is able to wash his face with hand soap. In my case, my acne is hormonal. Meaning, it doesn't really matter what I wash with or eat. So, while we're very glad that you have found a skincare regimen that works for you, chances are that it will not work for anyone else. Your unsolicited advice is just another reminder of how hopeless and exhausting our acne is. And to the esthetician I saw a couple of weeks ago, I have actually tried benzyl peroxide, but thank you so much for asking.
 
So where does this leave me? I'm 25 years old and my acne is as bad as ever. Well, if antibiotics are on Varsity, then Accutane is a D1 athlete. It's intense and its the best of the best. You can't walk into your doctor's office and just ask to be put on it. You need extensive and detailed records that show you have tried every other treatment you could. Even then, you have to do bloodwork to make sure your body can handle the drug. Which, by the way, is technically not Accutane. The active ingredient that made Accutane its proprietary eponym is called Isotretinoin, a Vitamin A derivative that essentially depletes your pores of sebum. Accutane is not even on the market anymore, but it's still what pretty much everyone in dermatology calls it. That said, if you are prescribed Accutane and are also able to get pregnant you are required to enroll in a program called iPledge. It's extensive and at times, condescending. For the duration of your treatment you must sign paperwork that promises you will employ two forms of birth control. You might be required to go on the pill or get an implant or IUD. You also have to go to your doctor's office once a month and take a pregnancy test in their facility. You are given multiple, hefty packets stressing how dangerous the drug is to a fetus and one pamphlet with maybe two bullet points on the potential for permanent neurological damage and suicidal ideation. I took my first pill today.
 
The side effects are scary and my history with mental illness makes me more at risk to them. To those of you who haven't suffered from acne I'm sure this sounds insane. Why would I put myself through this? Why can't I love myself the way I am, for who I am despite the spots on my face? I've asked myself these questions too. But acne is a medical condition. Acne itself is linked to depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. I have experienced these feelings myself so I can tell you that no side effect could deter me. I want clear skin. I want it so badly that I don't care if my lips crack, my nose bleeds or my joints ache. In the month while I waited for my first dose I read incessantly about others' experiences with Accutane. Almost all of them by the end of their treatments had this to say to those of us still struggling: stop letting your skin hold you back. My reply?

2024-01-22,1705918162,My Experience with Accutane,"Hello :)

I see a lot of posts on this subreddit asking about the individual experiences people have with taking Accutane (Isotretinoin), so I thought I would post some of my own observations and tips/tricks I used while on the medication.

First of all, I was on a 20 mg daily dose for 4 weeks, and then was bumped up to 40 mg daily. If you are new to Accutane, most dermatologists will prescribe a lower dose initially to get your body used to the medication and to help reduce a potentially severe flare-up. Please note that your dermatologist can prescribe medications such as Prednisone when first commencing treatment to also assist in reducing the physical symptoms of an initial flare-up. Most times, the flare-up is due to the effects of Accutane working within your body. However, it is also common simply due to the fact that other medications are typically discontinued prior to starting the medication, causing a treatment gap between the time the previous medications were discontinued and the Accutane begins to start working.

While on Accutane, a simple and hydrating routine should be all that you need! Typically, this includes a gentle cleanser, moisturiser, and most importantly, a good sunscreen - you MUST wear sunscreen!!! Furthermore, a good lip balm is also necessary - your lips will dry out, and as this is practically a 100% guaranteed effect of the medication, dermatologists use it as an indication your medication is being absorbed properly. On this note, Isotretinoin is best taken with food, since it is highly lipophilic and the absorption within the body is greatly enhanced when taken with a meal.

Personally, I had dry skin, hair and lips, in addition to a bit of facial redness, nothing too over the top. Remember, the dryness is not a typical side-effect in the classical sense - it is expected that you will be quite dry, this is how Accutane works. After my course finished, the dryness and redness disappeared over the course of a month or two.

Do not expect your treatment to be linear and do not fall into the trap of thinking the medication is not working because you have used it for a few months and things don't seem to be improving. My skin took a dramatic change for the best through month 5 - yes, it can really take this long, but when it happens, it happens rather quickly! The medication continues to work for up to 2 months after your course has finished, so you can expect to see further improvements.

On this note, a lot of people tend to classify 'acne' as quite literally everything they are trying to treat: the actual pimples, but also the scarring, post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) and/or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Accutane does not *directly* treat the last three. However, as your skin begins to clear and your breakouts stop, the increased cellular turnover will help to fade the PIE and PIH left on the skin. If the skin is not constantly in a state of breaking out, which Accutane will address, your skin has the time to repair and heal itself, which ultimately leads to the disappearance of any PIE/PIH, given enough time. After your course, and if there is still any PIE/PIH or scarring left, other treatments to fix these issues can be considered.

Finally, if you are on Accutane and are struggling to get through it, I hear you, and I understand you. I was in the same position, but my gosh, **the results are life-changing.** Just remember to be patient, as hard as it is - I know it is emotionally and physically draining, but you are about to have the best skin of your life. Your family and friends love you regardless of your acne - it will be over soon, and when it is, promise yourself to go do all of the things you wanted to do but felt like you couldn't due to your acne.

If anybody is struggling and needs somebody to talk to, I am always happy to answer some questions about my experience. &lt;3",Accutane,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/19cse47/my_experience_with_accutane/,19cse47,"My Experience with Accutane Hello :)

2021-10-30,1635564999,3 Months into 10mg/day Update,"34/male

I went into isotretinoin 10mg/day at the beginning of August as a way to combat oiliness rather than acne. I definitely had an abundance of acne as well, but not to the extent that it negatively impacted my life. At least not enough to take an ongoing drug regimen for.

My oily skin feeling like someone slathered butter on me half an hour after washing, though? Hair that was limper then freshly cooked cup noodle? The type of oiliness where I was actually embarrassed to let my SO even touch me? These were definitely impacting my quality of life.

So, 10mg/day it was. I was hoping the low doses helped with minimizing the oil while also mitigating the popular side effects of the drug.

So?

**The Good:** 

-	The oil is gone. Just&gone. No matter how hard I workout, jog, or do sports now the skin stays dry (besides the sweat). Even under the humid summer of Japan I stayed completely dry.
-	My skin is so soooooo smooth now. I didnt even notice it before because I was too focused on the oil and acne, but my skin was pretty bumpy. Now? All gone. Just silken skin remaining.
-	Acne went away after a purge and just never came back. I notice the last remnants of the acne slowly healing and my face is redder than usual, but no new ones have replaced them for at least a month now. Its&I dont think i even remember the last time this has happened to me.
-	My hair. By god my hair. I can literally go an entire week without shampooing and itd stay the same. Id probably try for longer if it werent for my SO saying Im starting to stink.

**The Bad:** 

-	Night vision has gone kaput. Blind as a bat now at night time, making middle of the night toilet visits an adventure each time.
-	Lips are dry, though probably not as dry as what others have gone through at higher doses. I only need basic chapstick two or three times a day and its more or less manageable.
-	Joint pain in the morning. Before starting the drug I was pretty much good to go out of bed. I could pretty much hop down the steps two at a time to get breakfast ready. Now? Yeah Im gonna need that railing. Fortunately joint and back pain disappears by lunch and Im good until the next morning.


**The Ugly:**

-	Minor brain fog. So why is minor brain fog an Ugly for me? Ive pretty much measured this in how easy it is for me to hold a conversation in Japanese. Prior to starting I could hold most casual conversations pretty much fluently. After? I find myself having to pause a lot more and trace my memory for words I know I knew. I stammer a lot more now, repeat words a lot more. Its made talking just so much more burdensome.

2023-06-30,1688164864,A 29 year olds reflections on taking isotretinoin during my last month.,"Tl;dr: I regret not starting in my early 20s, some bizarre but tolerable side effects, and Ill really miss not needing to wash my hair every day.

Sorry for any formatting issues, I am on mobile.

So I am 29/F, and between 140-150 lbs. My dosage for the entire course was 60mg/day broken up into two doses. I started taking isotretinoin in early February of this year to treat the mild to moderate cystic acne flare ups Id get seemingly at random. The skin *around* the acne always looked really good, but the angry red cysts were painful and left scars or pigmentation that took ages to fade, if they did at all. 

I figured Id write about my experience on the off chance anybody else wants to commiserate or it helps somebody else looking for anecdotes.

I was absolutely terrified to start these meds. I already have clinical depression and was truly convinced Id be worse off for taking them. **I fully understand that many people experience brutal side effects and/or complications from this drug and dont want to diminish those experiences, but this was not the case for me.**

That said, of course I did have side effects. In addition to the typical dry skin, eyes, nose, and lips& these were what stuck out to me:

- Those deep painful cracks at the corners of your mouth are called angular chelitis and that shit SUCKS. Ive had it before throughout my life but isotretinoin turned them up to 11 and ultimately the only thing that has kept them at bay is topical tacrolimus ointment applied as needed. Honestly that was one of the worst side effects for me before I found a product that helped.

- I made it through month 1 without a purge and thought I was home free& LOL. By month 3 my skin looked worse than it had in at least a year. It still wasnt the worst breakout I have ever had, but it was definitely bad and uncomfortable. By about halfway through month 4 though, my skin had completely changed for the better. I was in awe. Seriously, trust the process!

- I couldnt pick because my skin got very thin and fragile quickly and would tear and scar anytime I tried and then Id have to explain to my derm that I fucked up when she noticed the wound on my face. Got me out of the habit fast.

- My dry nose would get crusty, huge boogers. TMI I know, but seriously it is disgusting. No clue what thats about but some posts in this sub seem to suggest Im not alone in experiencing this. My derm couldnt explain it but its definitely a thing and its nasty.

- I live in California and staying out of the sun felt like a full time job. If I were in my car, the backs of my hands would start to burn without sunscreen. My feet have tan lines in the shape of my flats right now from the days I forgot to coat them in SPF. Everywhere I went I wore a giant wide brim visor or hat, covered my arms with a UPF top or bolero, and used at least 1/4 tsp of SPF over my entire face and neck area. After all that, sometimes Id STILL get a little pink if I was walking outside for an extended period.

- I have a lot more blonde peach fuzz on my face right now than I normally do. It doesnt really bother me at all and in fact I think gives you a nice glow in the right light. They say old Hollywood starlets would use estrogen cream on their faces to make peach fuzz grow because of how it made them look glowy on screen! However, it does make my concealer apply less well. I dont wear foundation all over though so it didnt affect my makeup too much overall. 

- I saw somebody post that isotretinoin made their cuticles disappear. I thought it was bullshit but by month 3 they were gone. What a trip.

- Im really going to miss having no sebaceous filaments whatsoever. That was the first positive change I had on the meds. Ill also miss having hair that isnt oily within a day.

- I went from somebody who barely sweat during workouts to somebody who perspires heavily to the point where its dripping off my face. A little embarrassing for me. It also did make me fatigue much faster, I had to start pausing for a bit longer between sets or I would get very dizzy and lightheaded. I almost passed out once or twice before I figured it out.

- I have always been terrible about drinking water. But now I can drink almost a gallon a day on a good week. I still slip up but its miles ahead of where I was when I started.

- I did experience some mild muscle aches but they werent consistent. Sometimes my lower back, neck, and shoulders would ache but it would come and go and it was never enough to seriously debilitate me. Advil seemed to help most of the time.

- The dry skin on my face was pretty easy to avoid once I perfected my skincare routine, it really only got flaky if I slacked off on that. My lips were another story though, theres truly no stopping them from peeling while youre on this drug lol. The worst thing wasnt the dryness though, it was the random flushing and redness that can happen at anytime. Ice rollers and an anti redness mask helped me a bit but it was impossible to totally avoid. **If any late 20s early 30s peeps are interested in what products I used for my skincare routine and/or what I used to mitigate other side effects, Id be happy to share in a comment or another post :)**


To be honest, at this point I am more anxious about stopping the meds than I am about taking them. I fully expect Ill have an occasional pimple but Ill be pretty bummed if the full blown cysts come back with a vengeance.

Tl;dr: I regret not starting in my early 20s, some bizarre but tolerable side effects, and Ill really miss not needing to wash my hair every day.

Sorry for any formatting issues, I am on mobile.

So I am 29/F, and between 140-150 lbs. My dosage for the entire course was 60mg/day broken up into two doses. I started taking isotretinoin in early February of this year to treat the mild to moderate cystic acne flare ups Id get seemingly at random. The skin *around* the acne always looked really good, but the angry red cysts were painful and left scars or pigmentation that took ages to fade, if they did at all. 

I figured Id write about my experience on the off chance anybody else wants to commiserate or it helps somebody else looking for anecdotes.

I was absolutely terrified to start these meds. I already have clinical depression and was truly convinced Id be worse off for taking them. **I fully understand that many people experience brutal side effects and/or complications from this drug and dont want to diminish those experiences, but this was not the case for me.**

That said, of course I did have side effects. In addition to the typical dry skin, eyes, nose, and lips& these were what stuck out to me:

- Those deep painful cracks at the corners of your mouth are called angular chelitis and that shit SUCKS.

2020-03-18,1584508998,Accutane and Testosterone/DHT and long-term effects,"Hello

After reading about several studies regarding the usage of isotretinoin it has come to my attention that it lowers DHT levels, a very important male hormone that effects your strength, energy, and mood. It is several times more potent than testosterone. Apparently, it can also lower your testosterone as well. I am very concerned about this medication's long term impact on my endocrine system. I value my androgenic hormones as they are what make me a man. Likewise, as an athlete and someone who is very into strength training, I do not want to be hindered by lower or incorrect levels of test, DHT, and potentially other hormones from this drug. Additionally, I have developed a minor case of gynecomastia behind my right nipple. This can actually be a side effect of the accutane as it can lower the effectiveness of testosterone. I don't like that my body is aromatizing. I had these bumps in about 6th grade but not really after that.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any personal experiences, 5 or 10 years out from their last dose of accutane regarding their libido, strength, and general virility?

Will this drug lower my DHT levels permanently, later in life, or just as i'm taking it? My understanding is that lowered DHT levels are either a result or the cause of little to no sebum production so if I never get acne again it is because my DHT has never gone back up. \[?\]

Likewise, will accutane lower my levels of test permanently, later in life, or just briefly right now?

&amp;#x200B;

After hearing of men losing their libido, erections, and general drive in life due to this drug I am genuinely a little freaked out. I only have 7 days left and I have debated just throwing out my last few packs of pills.

If I did want to stop, will reaching a cumulative dose of 202ish out of 216 have any impact?

&amp;#x200B;

FYI I am taking a pretty high dose. My months looked like 40, 80, 120, 120 \[40 days\], 160, and now 200 \[for 20ish days I believe\] mgs. Probably one of the riskier things i've done is take 200 mg to shorten the amount of time i'm taking it in order to salvage my sports season. I was supposed to take 120mgs for 40 days instead. No, I am not crumbling in the wind from dryness. Besides joint pain and general dryness, I think I feel fine. I am curious to see what it is like coming off...

2024-09-10,1725963313,"Take an antihistamine with your isotretinoin (if you want, this is not medical advice)","While I have the study up on my phone, I thought I would drop a summary and the link for the potential benefits of taking an antihistamine along with your isotretinoin.

Summary:
A number of studies have compared the effect on using an oral antihistamines (desloratadine+isotretinoin or levocetirizine+isotretinoin) against isotretinoin alone. This paper is a meta-analysis of six studies, involving 388 participants. Non- inflammatory and inflammatory lesions were counted, acne severity scored, and patient satisfaction graded during the studies. From the network metaanalysis, levocetirizine+isotretinoin was better than the isotretinoin alone in the inflammatory lesion count, but not in the non-inflammatory lesion count (no difference). The desloratadine+isotretinoin retained the best balance in terms of non-inflammatory lesion count, inflammatory lesion count, acne flare, and mucocutaneous adverse events. The duration of the studies was between 12-16 weeks. NO major adverse reactions were noted. Antihistamine doses were one standard dose per day.

My opinion:
As a girl of science, I think this paper gives a good indicator of the potential benefits that antihistamines can have in isotretinoin treatment for acne. There seems to be no major increase in adverse events in the antihistamine groups and the authors conclude that this is a considerably safe addition to treatment in the short term. Only two kinds of antihistamines were tested in these studies, desloratadine and levocetirizine. For those in Australia, levocetirizine seems to be unavailable to access OTC, but cetirizine is the 'father' chemical compound that contains levocetirizine (and another inactive compound). So in theory, cetirizine should be stand in for levocetirizine. With no likely increase in adverse reactions and a potential reduction in purging, I think an antihistamine should be in every Accutane users back pocket! I personally have been taking one for 3 or my 4 weeks so far, and I've had a small purge, so it isn't a magic cure-all that will make your isotretinoin start working and clear your skin immediately. BUT, it can help keep things from being worse, and isn't that the dream!

2024-11-10,1731220896,My Accutane Experience,"Hi Redditors! :)

I frequently see a lot of posts on this sub-reddit asking about the individual experiences people have with taking Accutane (Isotretinoin), so I just thought I would share some of my own observations and tips/tricks I used while on the medication.

First of all, I was on a 20 mg daily dose for 4 weeks, and then I was bumped up to 40 mg daily. If you are new to Accutane, most dermatologists will prescribe a lower dose initially to get your body used to the medication and to help reduce a potentially severe flare-up. Please note that your dermatologist can prescribe medications such as Prednisone when first commencing treatment to also assist in reducing the physical symptoms of an initial flare-up. Most times, the flare-up is due to the effects of Accutane working within your body. However, it is also common simply due to the fact that other medications are typically discontinued prior to starting the medication, causing a treatment gap between the time the previous medications were discontinued and the Accutane begins to start working. On this note, purging is such an unpredictable thing and is completely unique to each person; just because somebody you know purged does not mean that you will share the same experience.

While on Accutane, a gentle, simple and hydrating routine should be all that you need! Typically, this includes a gentle cleanser, moisturiser, and most importantly, a good sunscreen - you MUST wear sunscreen!!! Furthermore, a good lip balm is also necessary - your lips will dry out, and as this is practically a 100% guaranteed effect of the medication; dermatologists use it as an indication your medication is being absorbed properly. On this note, Isotretinoin is best taken with food, since it is highly lipophilic and the absorption within the body is greatly enhanced when taken with a meal.

Personally, I had dry skin, hair and lips, in addition to a bit of facial redness, nothing too over the top. Remember, the dryness is not a typical side-effect in the classical sense - it is expected that you will be quite dry, this is how Accutane works. After my course finished, the dryness and redness disappeared over the course of a month or two.

Do not expect your treatment to be linear and do not fall into the trap of thinking the medication is not working because you have used it for a few months and things don't seem to be improving. My skin took a dramatic change for the best through month 5 - yes, it can really take this long, but when it happens, it happens rather quickly! The medication continues to work for up to 2 months after your course has finished, so you can expect to see further improvements.

On this note, a lot of people tend to classify 'acne' as quite literally everything they are trying to treat: the actual pimples, but also the scarring, post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) and/or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Accutane does not *directly* treat the last three. However, as your skin begins to clear and your breakouts stop, the increased cellular turnover will help to fade the PIE and PIH left on the skin. If the skin is not constantly in a state of breaking out, which Accutane will address, your skin has the time to repair and heal itself, which ultimately leads to the disappearance of any PIE/PIH, given enough time. After your course, and if there is still any PIE/PIH or scarring left, other treatments to fix these issues can be considered.

Finally, if you are on Accutane and are struggling to get through it, I hear you, and I understand you. I was in the same position, but my gosh, **the results are life-changing.** Just remember to be patient, as hard as it is - I know it is emotionally and physically draining, but you are about to have the best skin of your life. Your family and friends love you regardless of your acne - it will be over soon, and when it is, promise yourself to go do all of the things you wanted to do but felt like you couldn't due to your acne. No more hiding from the lights, making up excuses as to why you can't hang out with your friends, avoiding mirrors and photographs...you got this!! 

If anybody is struggling and needs somebody to talk to, I am always happy to answer some questions about my experience. &lt;3",Accutane,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1gnuofo/my_accutane_experience/,1gnuofo,"My Accutane Experience Hi Redditors! :)

However, it is also common simply due to the fact that other medications are typically discontinued prior to starting the medication, causing a treatment gap between the time the previous medications were discontinued and the Accutane begins to start working. On this note, purging is such an unpredictable thing and is completely unique to each person; just because somebody you know purged does not mean that you will share the same experience.

While on Accutane, a gentle, simple and hydrating routine should be all that you need! Typically, this includes a gentle cleanser, moisturiser, and most importantly, a good sunscreen - you MUST wear sunscreen!!! Furthermore, a good lip balm is also necessary - your lips will dry out, and as this is practically a 100% guaranteed effect of the medication; dermatologists use it as an indication your medication is being absorbed properly. On this note, Isotretinoin is best taken with food, since it is highly lipophilic and the absorption within the body is greatly enhanced when taken with a meal.

Personally, I had dry skin, hair and lips, in addition to a bit of facial redness, nothing too over the top. Remember, the dryness is not a typical side-effect in the classical sense - it is expected that you will be quite dry, this is how Accutane works. After my course finished, the dryness and redness disappeared over the course of a month or two.

Do not expect your treatment to be linear and do not fall into the trap of thinking the medication is not working because you have used it for a few months and things don't seem to be improving. My skin took a dramatic change for the best through month 5 - yes, it can really take this long, but when it happens, it happens rather quickly! The medication continues to work for up to 2 months after your course has finished, so you can expect to see further improvements.

On this note, a lot of people tend to classify 'acne' as quite literally everything they are trying to treat: the actual pimples, but also the scarring, post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) and/or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH). Accutane does not *directly* treat the last three. However, as your skin begins to clear and your breakouts stop, the increased cellular turnover will help to fade the PIE and PIH left on the skin. If the skin is not constantly in a state of breaking out, which Accutane will address, your skin has the time to repair and heal itself, which ultimately leads to the disappearance of any PIE/PIH, given enough time. After your course, and if there is still any PIE/PIH or scarring left, other treatments to fix these issues can be considered.

Finally, if you are on Accutane and are struggling to get through it, I hear you, and I understand you. I was in the same position, but my gosh, **the results are life-changing.** Just remember to be patient, as hard as it is - I know it is emotionally and physically draining, but you are about to have the best skin of your life. Your family and friends love you regardless of your acne - it will be over soon, and when it is, promise yourself to go do all of the things you wanted to do but felt like you couldn't due to your acne. No more hiding from the lights, making up excuses as to why you can't hang out with your friends, avoiding mirrors and photographs...you got this!! 

If anybody is struggling and needs somebody to talk to, I am always happy to answer some questions about my experience. &lt;3"

So I am not sure if I will be able to frame all my struggles into words but I will try my best. Any constructive criticism or insights shall be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance d

So I am an 23 year old Indian male. In a third world country like India, ""acne related mental health issues"" ain't given much importance and my family isn't an exception either xD. I have been suffering from persistent moderate acne for the past 10 years. It has taken a heavy toll on my mental health. I visited some local dermatologists and they prescribed me antibiotics and tropical medications. None of them have been able to create a significant improvement to my persistent acne. 

I have eliminated sugar, carbs, dairy and deep fried foods from my diet. I incorporated a strict skin-care regime which includes 2% salicylic acid serum, epiduo gel, moisturizer and sunscreen. I drink 3-4 litres of water everyday and maintain my sleep cycle. None of these things seem to work.

I am considering switching to oral doses of isotretinoin (Accutane). Dermatologists here aren't very keen to try that out it seems and self medication sounds like a good plan to me. I am well aware of the side effects. I just need to know how to use Accutane in my routine, any precautions that should be taken and the proper doses of Accutane that is required.

Im not much of a redditor but kept finding myself  back here after googling my very upsetting accutane slash isotretinoin side effects. I was started on 40mg daily and within two weeks noticed that my extremely high and reliable sex drive (34F) completely disappeared. My sensitive areas, to be modest, might as well have had the sensation of my elbow. I immediately went off and this persisted for one month after stopping the medication. I kept seeing posts, some research (though all by the same MD) that these effects were permanent, lasted years, etc and I was terrified. So, I came back here today in case in the years to come there are any other people like me looking this up to let you know after about five weeks of zero sensation (with maybe like occasional 10% ability to come here and there) I woke up yesterday and it came back just like it always was.

I kept seeing posts, some research (though all by the same MD) that these effects were permanent, lasted years, etc and I was terrified. So, I came back here today in case in the years to come there are any other people like me looking this up to let you know after about five weeks of zero sensation (with maybe like occasional 10% ability to come here and there) I woke up yesterday and it came back just like it always was. It was not permanent. That is all I want to share :) happy to answer any questions or DMs."

This antibiotic worked wonders for me and completely cleared up my skin only leaving me with the post acne hyperpigmentation and scarring. But after about 15 months on the antibiotic my skin just gradually started getting worse and worse again until where Im at now (although still not as bad as before). I guess my body developed a resistance to the drug and it stopped being so effective. I read that usually antibiotics are prescribed in combination with an active ingredient or retinoid such as benzoyl peroxide, in my case I did not use this throughout my course which may have been the reason for it losing its effectiveness.

2022-05-07,1651964261,Getting pregnant while taking Accutane,"tl;dr: Got pregnant 3 weeks after starting 30mg accutane treatment. Was still taking it on and off for about a month into pregnancy up until i found out i was pregnant. Was terrified of birth defects. Currently almost at 20 weeks, with multiple ultrasounds confirming that baby is perfectly healthy and developing correctly, as he should. 

Hope this helps any future moms who got pregnant on acutane as well. You got this, dont be discouraged, you're not alone. don't let what people might tell you or what you find on the internet make you feel like you and your baby are doomed, because it is possible to have a healthy pregnancy despite it.

writing this post because im 19 almost 20 weeks along with my first, and i had major concerns because i was on accutane when i got pregnant. My pregnancy started on December 22nd 2021 (pregnancy starts from the first day of your last period) and i conceived on January 5th. i got prescribed accutane around mid December and had started taking it around December 18 all the way until January 10th. I was really bad at documenting every single oral intake, and was on and off of it during most of January. 

I completely stopped taking it on January 22nd, the day i missed what was supposed to be the first day of my period and got suspicions that i might be pregnant. (at that point i was 1 month pregnant, 2 weeks from conception.) As you can guess this wasn't a planned pregnancy. My dermatologist and every one that was taking accutane had hammered into my head that one comment of ""don't get pregnant"" and i felt terrible and guilty that i had did exactly that. I was terrified of the baby having really bad birth defects or worse, the pregnancy, or life outside the womb not being viable. 

Well, i did my first ultrasound on March 15th and it revealed that everything was ok. His nuchal clarity was normal, he was moving and very active. i did the anatomy scan on April 19th (at 17 weeks) where i saw my baby's perfect hands, each counting five fingers, his brain split into two hemispheres and developing correctly, his beautiful rib cage that ressembled a perfect palm tree. Facial features looked normal, his femurs are well developed as well as all other internal organs. He is actually a week ahead of gestational age in terms of height and weight. Doctors and ultrasound technicians told me he is doing perfectly fine. 

Im writing this post because i know i was terrified, googling the side effects of Isotretinoin on fetuses, worrying myself to death looking at the pictures and even wondering at some point if i would keep the baby. i had read another post on r/Accutane titled ""Pregnancy after Accutane"" and the comments of women that had also had healthy pregnancies despite not being off of accutane for a long time definitely made me feel better and gave me some hope. 

Don't give up hope, if you know you want to have this baby, stay positive and go get those ultrasounds and tests done. You're not alone, and i hope you (or your partner) have a safe and healthy pregnancy and delivery.=O (my due date is Sept. 28th 2022) If you or someone you know have a similar experience with accutane/isotretinoin and pregnancy please, comment below.

2017-03-31,1490928049,How to maintain healthy hair and scalp on Accutane,"As you may know, one of the most common side effects of isotretinoin is a dry, irritated scalp. Just as isotretinoin reduces oil production on your face and body, you will find that the same thing happens on your scalp. This is great for some people as you don't have to wash your hair as often as you did before, but often it can leave you with a painful, tender, flaky scalp that can be enough to drive you crazy.  

This side effect set in within about a week for me. I woke up one morning feeling like I had chemical burns on my head. As I tend to do with just about everything, I turned to the internet to see just what I could do about it.

Enter **cowashing!** Co-washing is short for conditioner washing, or cleansing your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo. It is a method often used by people with naturally wavy or curly hair (which is inherently drier than straight hair) as a means of avoiding the oil-stripping nature of shampoo and keeping the hair and scalp in a healthy, hydrated state.  

Shampoo contains harsh sulfates that are designed to both remove oil from the scalp and hair, and to cleanse it of non water soluble silicones that are present in many conditioning products. Sulfates are also the likely culprit behind why your hair might have gotten greasy just 1-2 days after washing it before you started Accutane--as it throws off your body's natural production of oil.

I had actually tried cowashing in the past because I had heard such great things about it, but I couldn't get through the initial adjustment period. Normally, as your scalp adjusts to not being constantly stripped by sulfates, there is an adjustment period where your scalp will be extra greasy for about 4-6 weeks. However, the beauty of being on Accutane means that we get to skip the transition period all together. Cheat codes :)  

**How to get started:** You will need to purchase two items: a cheap, lightweight conditioner for your scalp and a heavy, moisturizing conditioner for the rest of your hair. Neither of these items should contain silicones, or any ingredient ending in ""cone"" or ""con"". Since you will no longer be using sulfates, silicones can build up in hair over time leaving it heavy and dirty looking. My favorite conditioner for my scalp is any of the Suave Naturals conditioners ($2.99 for a giant container at most grocery stores) and my favorite conditioner for the rest of my hair is any of the deep conditioners from the brand SheaMoisture. You certainly can just use the Suave for both purposes, but I like to incorporate a deep conditioner to keep my hair as healthy as possible.  
**Instructions:**  
* Wash your hair one last time with a shampoo containing sulfates. You will need to remove any silicones that might be in your hair. Be sure to follow it up with the silicone free conditioner.  
* The next time you shower, wet hair your and scalp completely. Take a generous portion of the Suave and saturate your scalp. Let this sit for 3-4 minutes  
* Get to scrubbin'. Use the pads of your fingers (NO FINGERNAILS!) to somewhat firmly rub the conditioner into your scalp. Be sure to do this over your entire head.  You should spend at least two minutes doing this.  
* Rinse! Run your head under the water, and as you rinse, continue to scrub with the pads of your fingers. Feel for any residue, you want to be sure you get it all.  
* At this point, I saturate the rest of my hair with my SheaMoisture deep conditioner and let that sit for 5 minutes as I finish up in the shower.  
* I rinse out the conditioner completely, then take another dime sized amount of the deep conditioner for my medium-length hair and distribute it evenly through my soaking wet hair. I do not rinse after this. 
That's it! After starting this method, my scalp irritation went away within a week. My scalp never hurts, and I get ZERO flakes. My scalp and hair are actually healthier than they were prior to taking Accutane. The additional plus is that I can continue doing this after Accutane and reap the benefits of shiny, lustrous hair!  

Two things I must add: you MIGHT have luck with using a low sulfate shampoo, but I didn't. That was actually what I was using when the side effects began in the first place. Also, I often see people recommend dandruff shampoo as a remedy for the flaking scalp due to Accutane. I strongly advise against this, as dandruff shampoos are both loaded with sulfates and often contain actives that are inherently drying.

2019-09-08,1567979254,ADVICE for ACCUTANE  INFO DUMP,"Long, but Im sharing my experience and advice to hopefully give guidance, ease and hope to those enduring the process or deciding to start. I (22F) was on Accutane (isotretinoin) for 5 months (dosage 20,40,40,60,60mg) and have only been off it for 2 weeks. Tried to write this going from general --&gt; specifics 

As a teen, tried everything for my acnenothing cured it but it was manageable. Then in college I got cystic breakouts and decided to take the plunge. Non-hormonal IUD for birth control (that was a beast in itself) and bloodwork later I started Accutane. 

**IM SO GLAD I DID**

THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE:

\- RISK for permanent issues (nighttime blindness, Meibomian gland dysfunction, depression, bone and body aches and others) 

\- Bloodwork once a month to turn in a few days before your monthly derm appointment 

\- PRICE including monthly bloodwork, monthly derm appointment, birth controls, and medication ($90 a month for my meds alone, $90 for appointments and $30 for blood = $1000 for the 5 months (not including lotions etc.) 

\- Birth-control  you need 2 forms (celibacy, condoms, IUD, diaphragm, pills, etc)

\- Less sun and less alcohol (not too bad in my opinion) 

WHAT HAPPENED

\- Timeline of acne: month 1-2 acne got a little worse but face was more even (cleanses out every pore basically, nothing crazy, but I broke out on my cheeks and I never did before) month 3-4 my pores were tiny and some bigger pimples but no black/whiteheads, month 5 was basically clear the whole time and now (month 6) my face is even, not read, evenly oily/dry, tight, and clear!! 

\- Symptoms: these SSUCKEDD but they were never debilitating.

o  Dry skin (used lotions, drank water, took vitamin E and Fish Oil)

o  Bone aches (took magnesium and vitamin D, my back, chest, and feet ached mostly in month 1-3 but got better after)

o  Lethargy (energy was low from muscle and bone aches, made it harder to want to work out, but working out did not add to the pain)

o  Eye sight (my sight got fuzzy and I still need to get a check-up about my field of vision, but I could see at night. My eyes were not terribly dry, but I used drops every once in a while. I have glaucoma and my eye pressures were elevated, but nothing too drastic) 

o  Depression (would be about 4 days a month randomly, would be worse on my period, got better if I got sun/worked out and distracted myself) 

o  Mood Swings (again mostly on period)

o  Vivid Dreams (could be from sleep apnea)

o  Sleep Apnea (only noticed during month 2 a few times, no real issues) 

o  Bloody nose (only if I did not apply Aquaphor inside of it before bed/waking up)

WHAT WORKED for me

\- Aquaphor was my best friend, brought travel tubes with me everywhere (not the ones made for lips, but just small versions of the thicker petroleum). Apply constantly to your lips and at night to the corners to your mouth and inside your nose (with a Q tip)

\- Cetaphil Face/Body lotion and cleanser (made my face look oily but I used a loose powder on top)

\- WATER, vitamin D, vitamin E, fish oil

SPECIFIC EXTRAS

\- I drank alcohol, but not a lot because a little sip would get me buzzed and after a whole drink I was a good buzzed/drunk depending on how much water I had that day. My blood levels never showed any different or negative results from drinking. 

\- I would go in the sun with loads of sunscreen, but would not get tan, only red. After a night the color would disappear. So I found it easier to cover up in the sun and took vitamin D as well (for depression and aches).

\- Not using shampoo and just applying conditioner from root to tip of hair. My hair would absorb all of it and I always had dry hair.

TWO WEEKS OFF

\- No more cracked lips or cracked corners!

\- My energy is returning and no more aches!

\- I still have dark spots but I am going to try the vitamin C lotions

\*This process SUCKED, but the results are WORTH IT! If you have Qs please let me know. The depression part was the worst, then the bone aches. Know that this pain is temporary and you have the option to stop whenever. Talk to fellow Accutaners, and to your doctors. Mental and physical health is at risk if you dont. Remember to surround yourself with beauty and focus on cleansing your insides as well during this medication.

I (22F) was on Accutane (isotretinoin) for 5 months (dosage 20,40,40,60,60mg) and have only been off it for 2 weeks. Tried to write this going from general --&gt; specifics 

As a teen, tried everything for my acnenothing cured it but it was manageable. Then in college I got cystic breakouts and decided to take the plunge. Non-hormonal IUD for birth control (that was a beast in itself) and bloodwork later I started Accutane. 

**IM SO GLAD I DID**

THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE:

\- RISK for permanent issues (nighttime blindness, Meibomian gland dysfunction, depression, bone and body aches and others) 

\- Bloodwork once a month to turn in a few days before your monthly derm appointment 

\- PRICE including monthly bloodwork, monthly derm appointment, birth controls, and medication ($90 a month for my meds alone, $90 for appointments and $30 for blood = $1000 for the 5 months (not including lotions etc.) 

\- Birth-control  you need 2 forms (celibacy, condoms, IUD, diaphragm, pills, etc)

\- Less sun and less alcohol (not too bad in my opinion)

2024-05-26,1716726021,The Cause of The 'Accutane Nose Job',"**Introduction**

Whilst Accutane has been found to be a potent treatment for severe cystic acne, some patients find the cosmetic effects arent just skin deep. The so called Accutane nose job is the observation that following treatment the retinoid, their nose is noticeably smaller than before the treatment. Despite the abundance of anecdotal evidence available on social media, theres relatively little evidence in the clinical literature to substantiate this curious side effect.



**Key Points:**

* Whilst the exact cause of Accutanes efficacy in treating acne is still poorly understood, it is at least partially to do with shrinking sebaceous glands.
* Theres plenty of anecdotal evidence for Accutane visibly shrinking the nose, an effect often attributed to reducing the size of these oily glands on the surface of the skin.
* The cause of the Accutane nose job is likely more than skin deep, and has to do with effects of Retinoic Acid (the main metabolite of Accutane) on the cartilage structures.
* By disrupting the cells that make up cartilage called Chondrocytes, Accutane can not only visibly shrink the nose, but also cause joint discomfort and even damage.
* Cartilage has a limited capacity for repair, suggesting the Accutane nose job may well be lasting. Equally, any detrimental effects to joints could also persist after treatment.

 

**Accutane triggers cell death**

Despite being in use for over four decades, the reason for Isotretinoins efficacy in permanently **resolving acne is still relatively mysterious**. At the very least its understood that Accutane shrinks the oily sebaceous glands on the surface skin. \[1\] The surface of the nose is particularly abundant in these oily glands, which has led some to conclude that the Accutane nose job is another consequence of this process of **sebocyte cell death (apoptosis).**

Whilst the shrinking of sebaceous glands may well contribute to changes in the appearance of the skin texture, there is a more probable cause for this occasionally desirable side effect. [Those whove been treated with Accutane will appreciate that its effects arent limited to the skin, often suffering side effects related to vision, metabolic health, and not least  **bones and joints**.](https://secondlifeguide.com/post-accutane-syndrome/) As it turns out, the **same process of cell death that occurs within the sebaceous glands can also take place in the cartilage structures that compose the joints** in places such as the knees, shoulders, wrist etc.

 

**Retinoic Acid breaks down cartilage**

Most of the cells that make up these cartilage structures are called **Chrondrocytes**. They ensure that joints are both strong and also flexible. Without getting into too much detail, Accutane can **influence the survival of Chondrocytes by disrupting a key growth signalling pathway called Wnt/Beta-Catenin**. \[2\]\[3\] By inhibiting Beta-Catenin, **Retinoic Acid (the main metabolite of Accutane) triggers a breakdown in these cartilage structures that not only make up joints**, but also the majority of the nose too! \[4\]\[5\] [To better understand this mechanism, read here.](https://secondlifeguide.com/2023/11/04/how-accutane-causes-joint-pain-and-stunted-growth-and-why-lithium-helps/)

It's for this reason that complaints of joint pain are fairly common for those treated this acne medication**. A meta-analysis of over 3000 patients found as many as 17% reporting joint discomfort**. \[6\] Unfortunately Cartilage is one of the few tissues in the body thats bad at self repair. In mature cartilage structures, Chrondrocytes have a limited capacity for proliferation. This is why surgical intervention with grafts are often employed to restore damaged joints. \[7\] However this suggests that a noticeable reduction in the size of the nose after Accutane treatment would likely be a lasting change.

 

**Conclusion**

Whilst a slightly smaller nose could be seen as an attractive bonus for those seeking relief from their acne, it points to the troubling effect of Retinoic acid on cartilage throughout the body. This is of particular concern to those undergoing treatment during their key years of growth during teenager hood. This is because cartilage is also needed to form the template for new bone growth in a process of Endochondral Ossification.  Its possible that by prematurely sealing these growth plates, young patients may fail to achieve their predicted height goals. \[8\] The impact of Accutane on joint health should be carefully considered before initiating treatment.

## Background

I was struggling with acne for a long time, it all started when I was about 14 and then just kept getting worse every winter. In summer 2022 it was still pretty bad, which was surprising considering it used to be the best in the months of July and August, I was worried about what was about to come, I spent hours doing research on the internet ultimately finding the [acne.org](https://acne.org) regimen and starting to use 5% BP together with CeraVe [Blemish Control Cleanser](https://www.cerave.co.uk/our-products/blemish/blemish-control-cleanser) and [Moisturiser](https://www.cerave.co.uk/our-products/moisturisers/moisturising-cream).

## Month 0 (October)

By October 2022 it started becoming apparent that [BP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoyl_peroxide) was losing the battle, I was coming home with discomfort daily. The only time I left home to a competition it was unbearable, leading me to completely screw up my presentation. One night I woke up at 02:00 with 5 new cysts all over my face swelling awfully and being so painful I knew I had to do something. I cried my way to a dermatologist and straight-up asked for Accutane, I had to get my blood test first. In the meantime before Accutane that week I got a giant cyst under my eye, I could barely see, I knew I had made the right decision. There were some issues at the beginning before getting the prescription - my leukocyte levels were elevated making my doctor urge me to go the the otorhinolaryngologist. Although it was incredibly annoying at the time, it is to show that there is quite some effort to make sure isotretinoin is prescribed safely.

&amp;#x200B;

[My cheek in mid-October](https://preview.redd.it/5emxm56o3owa1.png?width=175&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d457bb03b68391afa955f857a6f3a45d08accc0)

&amp;#x200B;

## Preparations

I made myself a spreadsheet and printed it out, I marked all my side effects, ticked off my pills and most importantly tracked my progress. I used a scale of 1-10, with 1 being the best and 10 being the worst. I never used anything above 7 and anything below 2, but that is mostly just human behaviour. I calculated my ""improvement"" based on a 10 day average at the beginning of the month.

## Month 1 (November)

*Improvement - 13.5%* (5.7 -&gt; 5.2)

*Days sick - 40%* (12 out of 30)

*Side effects*

* groin and testicle pain (slowly washed away after 5 days since initial pill)
* dry lips (after about two weeks really awful)
* dry skin (despite all efforts still caused massive discomfort)
* first signs of compromised immunity (sick more than usual)

I took the first pill and my groins and testicles started hurting, I was really afraid of the pains and aches as I read about them, so maybe it was just psychosomatic, but it was really painful and for the first couple of days I really thought I would be forced to quit, eventually it mostly sorted itself out though. I was really desperate to see at least some progress the first month, but the only change was that I was getting *less* cysts, otherwise no difference whatsoever for weeks, healing was slow and painful. Also my skin was brutally dry despite my best efforts to stay moisturised. By the end of the month it was noticeably better.

## Month 2 (December)

*Improvement - 16.2%* (5.2 -&gt; 4.6)

*Days sick - 42%* (13 out of 31)

*Side effects*

* dry lips (less bad than used to be)
* dry skin (still very bad and painful)
* nosebleeds (not too often)
* severely weakened immune system (sick very often)
* severe fatigue
* hair not greasy anymore (actually positive!)
* mental impacts (demotivated, sick all the time, all compounding to a worsened mood)

By month 2 a problem started arising, I was really sick really often, I was getting colds many times a month and it was always bad enough that I could not go to school, I started falling behind in school due to absence and it was starting to be problematic. Skin was still feeling bad but visually improvements were quite major, by the end of the month (and the year), I was really really good-looking.

&amp;#x200B;

[My cheek in late December](https://preview.redd.it/qmv8ac4q3owa1.png?width=164&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3009cac7760251448fc8bead12a91b88e399188)

## Month 3 (January)

*Improvement - 16.2%* (4.6 -&gt; 4.0)

*Days sick - 26%* (12 out of 31)

*Side effects*

* dry lips (managable)
* dry skin (painful very much still)
* severy weakened immune system
* severe fatigue
* hair not greasy anymore
* mental impacts (demotivated, sick all the time, all compounding to a worsened mood)

Month 3 brought major changes, I got three really big cysts in the middle of the month, which took about a week to heal, but by the end of the month skin was so much clearer and prettier. I was still feeling really awful at times. Unfortunately, as the beginning was after a wonderful winter break the return back to reality was rough on acne, as shows the graph. For my immunity I started taking high-dose [vitamin C](https://www.drmax.cz/max-vitamin-c-500mg-pomeranc) and some [vitamin D](https://www.drmax.cz/max-vitamin-d3-1000-60-kapsli).

## Month 4 (February)

*Improvement - 40.5%* (4.0 -&gt; 2.5)

*Days sick - 40%* (11 out of 28)

*Side effects*

* dry lips (managable)
* dry skin (slowly recovering)
* severy weakened immune system
* severe fatigue
* hair not greasy anymore
* mental impacts (probably the worst they had been)

Everything improved drastically, I started using the [La Poche Rosay Effaclar H](https://www.laroche-posay.cz/effaclar/effaclar-h-iso-biome-care) moisturiser and it improved the feeling a ton, which resulted in my giving my skin was better ratings, I felt good, I did not care about acne as much as I used to. I was sick a lot, but that was not as much due to isotretinoin as it was to the month being full of exciting things.

## Month 5 (March)

*Improvement - 13.5%* (2.5 -&gt; 2.0)

*Days sick - 29%* (6 out of 31)

*Side effects*

* dry lips (manageable)
* dry skin (improving)
* weakened immune system
* some fatigue
* hair not greasy anymore
* mental impacts (improving)

In March there were some improvements still, acne became more of an exception than a rule, pimples showed here and there, at the end of the month, it got quite bad and painful, but well enough. My cholesterol was higher than average but good enough. My dermatologist recommended going off the drug, as he saw me exhausted after EYP and the skin looked healed very much, but remembering the pains of the previous week I insisted on one more month before finishing.

## Month 6 (April)

~~Improvement - -8.1% (2.0 -&gt; 2.3)~~

~~Days sick - 7% (2 out of 30)~~

Acne became very much a non-issue, funnily enough on the last day I got an ""outbreak"", mainly super dry skin, awful weather and one small whitehead under my month. I got really paranoid about it all coming back, but the mirror begs to differ. I was clear all month prior and hence I did (do) not want to undergo one more month just because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

[My cheek in mid-April](https://preview.redd.it/92l78n1s3owa1.png?width=196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=013aa1f88edf9c56d3c60a3d4a440c815d63a258)

## Results

It took its time, but the improvement was incredible. When I look at photos from October and now, it's a day and night difference. I was really hopeless in some moments, but I am really glad I have undergone the treatment. My biggest fear is it all coming back, something inside of me still tells me I should have taken it for longer, but the side effects are no joke, mainly in the upcoming summer it might will have done more harm than good. Appearance-wise all is perfect, though it still feels a bit dry, hopefully as Accutane completely leaves my system that will change, I will keep y'all updated hopefully.

In summer 2022 it was still pretty bad, which was surprising considering it used to be the best in the months of July and August, I was worried about what was about to come, I spent hours doing research on the internet ultimately finding the [acne.org](https://acne.org) regimen and starting to use 5% BP together with CeraVe [Blemish Control Cleanser](https://www.cerave.co.uk/our-products/blemish/blemish-control-cleanser) and [Moisturiser](https://www.cerave.co.uk/our-products/moisturisers/moisturising-cream).

## Month 0 (October)

By October 2022 it started becoming apparent that [BP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoyl_peroxide) was losing the battle, I was coming home with discomfort daily. The only time I left home to a competition it was unbearable, leading me to completely screw up my presentation. One night I woke up at 02:00 with 5 new cysts all over my face swelling awfully and being so painful I knew I had to do something. I cried my way to a dermatologist and straight-up asked for Accutane, I had to get my blood test first. In the meantime before Accutane that week I got a giant cyst under my eye, I could barely see, I knew I had made the right decision. There were some issues at the beginning before getting the prescription - my leukocyte levels were elevated making my doctor urge me to go the the otorhinolaryngologist. Although it was incredibly annoying at the time, it is to show that there is quite some effort to make sure isotretinoin is prescribed safely.

&amp;#x200B;

## Preparations

I made myself a spreadsheet and printed it out, I marked all my side effects, ticked off my pills and most importantly tracked my progress. I used a scale of 1-10, with 1 being the best and 10 being the worst. I never used anything above 7 and anything below 2, but that is mostly just human behaviour. I calculated my ""improvement"" based on a 10 day average at the beginning of the month.

## Month 1 (November)

*Improvement - 13.5%* (5.7 -&gt; 5.2)

*Days sick - 40%* (12 out of 30)

*Side effects*

* groin and testicle pain (slowly washed away after 5 days since initial pill)
* dry lips (after about two weeks really awful)
* dry skin (despite all efforts still caused massive discomfort)
* first signs of compromised immunity (sick more than usual)

I took the first pill and my groins and testicles started hurting, I was really afraid of the pains and aches as I read about them, so maybe it was just psychosomatic, but it was really painful and for the first couple of days I really thought I would be forced to quit, eventually it mostly sorted itself out though. I was really desperate to see at least some progress the first month, but the only change was that I was getting *less* cysts, otherwise no difference whatsoever for weeks, healing was slow and painful. Also my skin was brutally dry despite my best efforts to stay moisturised. By the end of the month it was noticeably better.

## Month 2 (December)

*Improvement - 16.2%* (5.2 -&gt; 4.6)

*Days sick - 42%* (13 out of 31)

*Side effects*

* dry lips (less bad than used to be)
* dry skin (still very bad and painful)
* nosebleeds (not too often)
* severely weakened immune system (sick very often)
* severe fatigue
* hair not greasy anymore (actually positive!)
* mental impacts (demotivated, sick all the time, all compounding to a worsened mood)

By month 2 a problem started arising, I was really sick really often, I was getting colds many times a month and it was always bad enough that I could not go to school, I started falling behind in school due to absence and it was starting to be problematic. Skin was still feeling bad but visually improvements were quite major, by the end of the month (and the year), I was really really good-looking.

&amp;#x200B;

## Month 3 (January)

*Improvement - 16.2%* (4.6 -&gt; 4.0)

*Days sick - 26%* (12 out of 31)

*Side effects*

* dry lips (managable)
* dry skin (painful very much still)
* severy weakened immune system
* severe fatigue
* hair not greasy anymore
* mental impacts (demotivated, sick all the time, all compounding to a worsened mood)

Month 3 brought major changes, I got three really big cysts in the middle of the month, which took about a week to heal, but by the end of the month skin was so much clearer and prettier. I was still feeling really awful at times. Unfortunately, as the beginning was after a wonderful winter break the return back to reality was rough on acne, as shows the graph. For my immunity I started taking high-dose [vitamin C](https://www.drmax.cz/max-vitamin-c-500mg-pomeranc) and some [vitamin D](https://www.drmax.cz/max-vitamin-d3-1000-60-kapsli).

## Month 4 (February)

*Improvement - 40.5%* (4.0 -&gt; 2.5)

*Days sick - 40%* (11 out of 28)

*Side effects*

* dry lips (managable)
* dry skin (slowly recovering)
* severy weakened immune system
* severe fatigue
* hair not greasy anymore
* mental impacts (probably the worst they had been)

Everything improved drastically, I started using the [La Poche Rosay Effaclar H](https://www.laroche-posay.cz/effaclar/effaclar-h-iso-biome-care) moisturiser and it improved the feeling a ton, which resulted in my giving my skin was better ratings, I felt good, I did not care about acne as much as I used to. I was sick a lot, but that was not as much due to isotretinoin as it was to the month being full of exciting things.

## Month 5 (March)

*Improvement - 13.5%* (2.5 -&gt; 2.0)

*Days sick - 29%* (6 out of 31)

*Side effects*

* dry lips (manageable)
* dry skin (improving)
* weakened immune system
* some fatigue
* hair not greasy anymore
* mental impacts (improving)

In March there were some improvements still, acne became more of an exception than a rule, pimples showed here and there, at the end of the month, it got quite bad and painful, but well enough. My cholesterol was higher than average but good enough. My dermatologist recommended going off the drug, as he saw me exhausted after EYP and the skin looked healed very much, but remembering the pains of the previous week I insisted on one more month before finishing.

## Month 6 (April)

~~Improvement - -8.1% (2.0 -&gt; 2.3)~~

~~Days sick - 7% (2 out of 30)~~

Acne became very much a non-issue, funnily enough on the last day I got an ""outbreak"", mainly super dry skin, awful weather and one small whitehead under my month. I got really paranoid about it all coming back, but the mirror begs to differ. I was clear all month prior and hence I did (do) not want to undergo one more month just because of that.

&amp;#x200B;

[My cheek in mid-April](https://preview.redd.it/92l78n1s3owa1.png?width=196&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=013aa1f88edf9c56d3c60a3d4a440c815d63a258)

## Results

It took its time, but the improvement was incredible. When I look at photos from October and now, it's a day and night difference. I was really hopeless in some moments, but I am really glad I have undergone the treatment. My biggest fear is it all coming back, something inside of me still tells me I should have taken it for longer, but the side effects are no joke, mainly in the upcoming summer it might will have done more harm than good. Appearance-wise all is perfect, though it still feels a bit dry, hopefully as Accutane completely leaves my system that will change, I will keep y'all updated hopefully.

&amp;#x200B;

2017-07-28,1501231429,"[PICS] 4 Weeks, Steroids &amp; Antibiotics, and a new dose!","Hello again, /r/Accutane!

I am back to give an update on my treatment. I am through with a WHOLE MONTHS WORTH of isotretinoin pills! Hooray! One down, 5+ more to go, lol.

So originally I was on 30mg, twice daily. After about two weeks, I had an insane initial breakout and it was PAINFUL. Let me tell you guys, I was eating ibuprofens 4-5 at a time, twice daily... and it WASN'T EVEN HELPING. On top of that I was so desperate I even started to spray numbing spray on my face while I waited for my emergency derm visit for relief! 

When I saw him he commented that my breakout was pretty intense and that he only sees this severity once every couple years. He put me on a course of Prednisone and Bactrim DS for two weeks. That helped a TON. I just finished and a bit of swelling and pain came back, but hopefully it doesn't go beyond tolerable levels again. 

(btw Prednisone tastes horrid. Bitter, bitter, bitter!)

Anyway, he also switched my dose down for some reason, commenting that my skin was reacting pretty intensely. I guess it was to make it easier on my skin. 

I also switched from Claravis to Absorica. My dose went from 30mg twice daily to 40mg daily. 

Other notes include that I had a pretty bad rash, eczema or something. It was itchy and dry, but it also kind of burned and stung... I've had cracked and dry, bleeding splitting lips, dandruff, plenty of nosebleeds. Headaches when I first started, but they stopped after 2 weeks.

Everything else seems to be going good so far. But I wish it would go by quicker!

2019-09-18,1568769502,"A Serious discussion of the drug's Short &amp; long term effects, from someone ~1 year off the pill","Content warning below for general discussion of medical episodes, mental health, and suicidal ideation. 

I was extremely averse to taking this medication at first, and I insisted on exhausting every other possible option for clearing up my cystic acne before I'd even consider accutane/isotretinoin. To simplify, I'll just say that I wasted years of my life bouncing back and forth between doctors and medications that reigned in surface-level breakouts to a point but did nothing for the real issue. I'll actually say up front that my worst experience with acne medication wasn't with accutane, but instead with doxycycline, due to one very specific occasion where I went hiking in a t-shirt and came back with severe antibiotic burns. No real sunburn, mind you, since I had used sunscreen. Doxy doesn't care. Doxy will punish you for any amount of sun exposure whether you greased up beforehand or not. Sleeping through that night with burns up and down my arm and a migraine fit for the gods was possibly the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.

If you're reading this you likely are now where I was around February of 2018- running out of options for curing a debilitating, embarrassing, and painful skin disease and seriously considering what my dermatologist calls the ""nuclear option""; shrinking the sebaceous glands in my skin to prevent acne from re-developing once healed, a la accutane. I was well aware of the potential side effects beforehand, and considering my luck of getting all the worse side effects of any given medication I really wasn't sure this was a good choice. 'I'd rather be ugly than dead', I would say to myself, but by the time my consultation appointment that February had arrived that wasn't true anymore. I just wanted to be relieved from the pain. 

When I started March of 2018, I was 18 years old, male, 6 feet tall, 135 pounds. Within a month of quitting the drug I gained 10 pounds, entirely in water weight- that's how serious of a dehydrator accutane is. I took 60 mg daily for 3 months, then 80 mg daily for 6 months. For those of you who aren't in the know- that is a *very* high dose for someone who isn't particularly heavy (dosage scales to weight). Keep that in mind.

It took about a month for my lips to dry out, so be on the lookout for that as soon as you start. Stock up on chapstick before you need it. I never needed to use anything more heavy-duty than that. A few months following, my skin and eyes started to dry out too. You may find some... *unexpected* orifices drying closed as well- that's a warning to the dudes. These things are normal and expected. For some of you, the side effects will end there.

Early in your course you're told to expect a 'purging' event, where acne sitting at lower layers of the skin gets pushed to the surface, making your acne worse than it was when you started. My purge cycle was pretty light, all things considered, possibly because *most* of my acne was at lower layers of skin so it's not like it was all going to come to the surface at once. After the purge, things slowly start to improve. If you keep up your skin care routine you will hopefully see progress through to the end of your treatment, ending when your skin has mostly cleared up.

I want to emphasize ""mostly"" in that sentence, because you need to manage expectations when it comes to treatment or you'll be frustrated and disappointed with the results. Ance, like depression, is a disease that is caused primarily by personal circumstance and body chemistry and is treated primarily by reducing its most pressing symptoms. Neither ever fully go away no matter how hard you try. Adults well into old age can get pimples. Perpetually flawless skin is a myth. Instead, be satisfied with progress; take pictures through your treatment, and always frame your current situation in comparison to where you were before. Hopefully, things are always looking up.

If you aren't lucky, some of the following side effects may also occur.

 Nosebleeds are apparently fairly common, I was lucky enough to only ever get one myself. Hair loss is a side effect that gets fretted over a lot, and I can attest to the fact that it does happen. Not the way pattern baldness does, mind you, just a general thinning all around. That includes eyebrows and eyelashes. Hair started breaking and falling out around the 4 month mark for me, and continued until a month after I finished the course. I have particularly long hair so I am still, to this day, dealing with frizzy young hairs that are slowly catching up to the length of the rest of my hair. That was the source of a lot of frustration and insecurity. If hair is important to you, start conditioning for damaged &amp; dry hair *before* it happens and you should be able to alleviate some of the effects.

Sun sensitivity is definitely a factor, though as I said above I never got hurt from it quite like Doxy fucked me sideways. It's not just that you burn more easily, it's that being in direct sunlight for even a short time feels uncomfortable, or even painful. If you're going to be active outdoors during your course, cover your entire body *and* use sunscreen as much as possible.

While the pain from cystic acne lessened during the course, pain from muscle aches and sore joints greatly increased. I was physically and mentally exhausted more often. Your mileage may vary, but be aware that people who already experience chronic pain will not find accutane an easy medication to deal with. Treat your body gently and don't be afraid to ask for help if you aren't up for certain tasks.

Redness and scarring has slowly improved in the last 10 months, but are far from fully gone and again may never be fully gone. Remember to moisturize during and after the course.

And finally: the mental health stuff.

You are warned when you begin the medication that you may experience depression and suicidal thoughts during the course. Accutane does not *cause* these things, but can make them significantly worse if you already deal with them. You may not deal with depression now, but it may coincidentally develop during treatment, so be vigilant for signs: my age, gender, and sexual orientation make me particularly at-risk for depression and suicidal ideation. My doctors checked in and asked about mental health during the course, and I simply said I was fine because I didn't have any idea how much worse off I was compared to the average person.

I was not in a particularly good place when I started treatment, and my mental health further declined after a difficult life event during month 6. I started having debilitating panic attacks which had never happened before and have not happened since I stopped taking the medication. However, the cascade of negative effects of poor mental health- low self esteem, weakened mental faculties, emotional unbalance, unhealthy self-image, thoughts of self-harm, and so on- they don't just evaporate once you stop the medication. You are left in a state of vulnerability. 2 months after finishing accutane my mental health fell off a cliff due to a completely unrelated event: an operational accident that caused (potentially permanent) nerve damage in a decent portion of my jaw. That marked the first time in my life where I crossed over from ""I really want to live, it's just really hard to keep your chin up sometimes"" to ""It's only a matter of time before I kill myself, the question is how, when, and where"". (Don't worry, this only lasted for a few days.) I'll never know for sure how much accutane contributed to the downward spiral that lead me to that point. All I can say is that **you need to take your mental health seriously** and seek treatment early and often, regardless of whether the medication and declining mental health are directly linked or are entirely unrelated.

In the end, after all that, you might think I don't consider treatment worth it, but honestly if I had to make the decision again I'd make the same choice. I may be a mess in a lot of ways but my scarring won't get any worse, my skin will only get better, and I won't ever again have a night where I can't sleep due to a severely inflamed cyst between my shoulder blades. I'll never again accidentally hit a cyst on my lower back while sitting in class and have to suppress a scream of pain. I'll never again have to drain blood from a cyst on my throat while looking at myself in the mirror like I'm a serial killer. That's something I wouldn't give up for nearly anything. 

**TL;DR: BE PROACTIVE ABOUT TREATING SIDE EFFECTS AND BE SMART ABOUT MANAGING EXPECTATIONS.**

If you have any questions, leave them below.",Accutane,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/d5qge7/a_serious_discussion_of_the_drugs_short_long_term/,d5qge7,"A Serious discussion of the drug's Short &amp; long term effects, from someone ~1 year off the pill Content warning below for general discussion of medical episodes, mental health, and suicidal ideation. 

I was extremely averse to taking this medication at first, and I insisted on exhausting every other possible option for clearing up my cystic acne before I'd even consider accutane/isotretinoin. To simplify, I'll just say that I wasted years of my life bouncing back and forth between doctors and medications that reigned in surface-level breakouts to a point but did nothing for the real issue. I'll actually say up front that my worst experience with acne medication wasn't with accutane, but instead with doxycycline, due to one very specific occasion where I went hiking in a t-shirt and came back with severe antibiotic burns. No real sunburn, mind you, since I had used sunscreen. Doxy doesn't care. Doxy will punish you for any amount of sun exposure whether you greased up beforehand or not. Sleeping through that night with burns up and down my arm and a migraine fit for the gods was possibly the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.

If you're reading this you likely are now where I was around February of 2018- running out of options for curing a debilitating, embarrassing, and painful skin disease and seriously considering what my dermatologist calls the ""nuclear option""; shrinking the sebaceous glands in my skin to prevent acne from re-developing once healed, a la accutane. I was well aware of the potential side effects beforehand, and considering my luck of getting all the worse side effects of any given medication I really wasn't sure this was a good choice. 'I'd rather be ugly than dead', I would say to myself, but by the time my consultation appointment that February had arrived that wasn't true anymore. I just wanted to be relieved from the pain. 

When I started March of 2018, I was 18 years old, male, 6 feet tall, 135 pounds. Within a month of quitting the drug I gained 10 pounds, entirely in water weight- that's how serious of a dehydrator accutane is. I took 60 mg daily for 3 months, then 80 mg daily for 6 months. For those of you who aren't in the know- that is a *very* high dose for someone who isn't particularly heavy (dosage scales to weight). Keep that in mind.

It took about a month for my lips to dry out, so be on the lookout for that as soon as you start. Stock up on chapstick before you need it. I never needed to use anything more heavy-duty than that. A few months following, my skin and eyes started to dry out too. You may find some... *unexpected* orifices drying closed as well- that's a warning to the dudes. These things are normal and expected. For some of you, the side effects will end there.

Early in your course you're told to expect a 'purging' event, where acne sitting at lower layers of the skin gets pushed to the surface, making your acne worse than it was when you started. My purge cycle was pretty light, all things considered, possibly because *most* of my acne was at lower layers of skin so it's not like it was all going to come to the surface at once. After the purge, things slowly start to improve. If you keep up your skin care routine you will hopefully see progress through to the end of your treatment, ending when your skin has mostly cleared up.

I want to emphasize ""mostly"" in that sentence, because you need to manage expectations when it comes to treatment or you'll be frustrated and disappointed with the results. Ance, like depression, is a disease that is caused primarily by personal circumstance and body chemistry and is treated primarily by reducing its most pressing symptoms. Neither ever fully go away no matter how hard you try. Adults well into old age can get pimples. Perpetually flawless skin is a myth. Instead, be satisfied with progress; take pictures through your treatment, and always frame your current situation in comparison to where you were before. Hopefully, things are always looking up.

If you aren't lucky, some of the following side effects may also occur.

2024-06-05,1717594043,Few things that MAY help - from someone who did not purge from low dose accutane,"Just like the majority of people on this medication, I've tried everything else for the past few years with inconsistent results (AHA, BHA, tretinoin, adapalene, antibiotic, birth control). When I started accutane, I dreaded the initial breakout phase since I've always experienced one from trying other products. I did a ton of research on my own and I'm here to share some of my notes, including peer-reviewed articles

**Disclaimer** : this post is about my experience with low dose accutane for mild/moderate acne (10mg/day epuris; 50kg F). Absolutely NOT claiming that any of this will prevent purging, reaction to accutane is case by case, there is no way to predict. Studies show that only a minority of people experience initial worsening (e.g., 27% [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9784036/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9784036/); 10% [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4009746/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4009746/)), meaning that my positive experience may not be a direct result from doing the things listed below. Similarly, I've seen many posts and comments of people saying that they simply did not purge despite not changing anything in their routine

**Antihistamines** : specifically Desloratadine (e.g., Aerius) and Levocetirizine (e.g., Xyzal). In theory, antihistamines should act in similar ways to reduce our immune reaction in cases of inflammatory acne. However, the first study listed below mentions that desloratadine would be more efficient in binding to H1-receptor (responsible for anti-inflammatory activity) than loratadine (e.g., Claritin). This leads me to believe that some antihistamines may be more effective than others, but please correct me if I'm wrong, as this is way beyond my field of studies. I chose Desloratadine simply because it was available at my local pharmacy. Here are some studies and a summary of their results :

* Desloratadine : [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25081735/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25081735/)  Control group: treated with isotretinoin only (20 mg per day, approximately 0.20.4 mg/kg per day). Treated group: combination therapy of isotretinoin and desloratadine (5 mg per day). At week 12 : treated group showed more statistically significant decrease in acne lesion counts, in score of global acne grading system and the measured value of sebum and erythema.
* Desloratadine : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364732/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6364732/) Control group : isotretinoin only (20mg per day). Treated group: combination therapy of isotretinoin and desloratadine (5 mg per day). At week 16 : treated group had significantly lower amounts of inflammatory lesions and global acne grading system score, but no differences in terms of non-inflammatory lesions and other side effects such as dry skin, cracked lips, flushing. 
* Levocetrizine : [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31734672/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31734672/)  Control group: isotretinoin only (10 mg and 20 mg, 0.5-0.6 mg/kg/day, after food). Treated group : combination therapy of isotretinoin and antihistamine, levocetrizine (5 mg/day, before sleep). At week 12 : more statistically significant decrease in score of global acne grading system and acne lesion counts.

**Red light therapy (low-level light therapy)** : this one is mitigated. Some professionals advise against it because accutane increases photosensitivity. My derm gave me the okay (maybe because i was on a lower dose?) and I chose the device from CurrentBody. Warning that those devices are quite expensive, but I saw this as a good investment as I was already looking at them for their potential anti-aging benefits ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38307144/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38307144/)). Now back to accutane, there are preliminary results suggesting that the combination of light-based therapy with accutane could be safe and efficient in reducing acne severity. Of note that these studies combined accutane with specific methods of application for the light-based therapy

* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8077247/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8077247/) : Effect of blue light 440460 nm administered with a photoconverter gel (FLE therapy) with isotretinoin 5mg/day or with tetracycline (antibiotic) 300mg/day. Results support the efficacy of combining lowdose systemic treatment with FLE therapy, although seemingly more efficient when combined with isotretinoin compared with tetracycline.
* [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35829974/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35829974/) : Combination of low-level light therapy administered using delicate pulse light (DPL) 500-600nm and isotretinoin (10-20 mg/day) significantly improved global acne grading system score, as well as the number of lesions.
* Other studies supporting the associations between light-based therapy and acne (without accutane) for those who are interested : [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18459515/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18459515/) : blue light (415 nm) in combination with red light (633 nm) self-administered by a handheld unit. Lesion counts progressively reduced throughout the 4-week light therapy period and continued to reduce up to 8 weeks posttherapy. // Reviews : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439741/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439741/) ; [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-16799-2\_4](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-16799-2_4)

**Hydrating face masks** : irritated moisture barrier may contribute to breakout severity. Many suggest a simple routine and I totally agree, but the thing that I really want to talk about is this extra step that made a big difference for me, which is daily masks using a hydrating toner. Its common practice in asian skincare to soak thin cotton pads (not sure if I'm allowed to post links to Amazon, but that's where I got them from) with a hydrating toner or essence and to leave it on like a face mask, followed by moisturizer. No scientific support for this one, purely from personal experience:)

**Mild actives** : it is ill-advised to use any actives while taking accutane since they could lead to excessive irritation. However, since I was doing fairly good with moisturizing (never experienced peeling), my skin tolerated mild actives, namely azelaic acid gel (15%), sulfur ointment mask (10 mins), and hypochlorus acid (0.015%; e.g. E11ement, Tower28). Those were not all used at the same time! I'm just listing some milder actives that my skin tolerated pretty well.

* Azelaic gel was actually prescribed by my derm. There are limited case studies reporting the combined usage of azelaic acid and accutane in female adult patients : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9975535/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9975535/) This preliminary study introduced azelaic acid at the last month of accutane treatment and examined the effect of azelaic acid usage post-treatment to deal with scarring and relapse : [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(15)00149-8/](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(15)00149-8/)  
* Sulfur : it has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, also known to be effective against fungal acne. Ive always suspected that some of my acne could be fungal (clusters of closed comedones that sometimes itch) so this one came out while I was researching that. Heres a review : [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15303787/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15303787/) Of note that current guidelines by the American Academy of Dermatology (2024) could not conclude to sufficient evidence to support specific recommendations regarding sulfur : [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(23)03389-3/](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(23)03389-3/)
* Hypochorus acid (HOCl): this molecule is naturally produced by our immune system and has antimicrobial properties. It is very well tolerated on sensitive skin and even used to treat dermatitis, so probably the mildest one compared to azelaic and sulfur. This review talks about a study that have found comparable benefits for reducing facial acne between HOCl and benzoyl peroxide, and both effects with HOCl and BP were significantly superior to placebo : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303114/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303114/)

Finally, I am not a dermatologist, and all studies have their limits (e.g., limited sample size, controlled lab environment). Please communicate with your doctor if your initial break out or side-effects worry you to discuss about potential solutions, especially if you are on a higher dosage. Healthcare professionals have much more clinical experience, so should be valued over the information from this post

I'm only 4 months into my treatment and my dermatologist plan on keeping me at 10mg for another 8 months given that mine was recurrent and stubborn.  I'd be more than happy to share my full experience by then:) Wish you all an amazing day and smooth sailing on your journey to clear skin!

Lesion counts progressively reduced throughout the 4-week light therapy period and continued to reduce up to 8 weeks posttherapy. // Reviews : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439741/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4439741/) ; [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-16799-2\_4](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-16799-2_4)

**Hydrating face masks** : irritated moisture barrier may contribute to breakout severity. Many suggest a simple routine and I totally agree, but the thing that I really want to talk about is this extra step that made a big difference for me, which is daily masks using a hydrating toner. Its common practice in asian skincare to soak thin cotton pads (not sure if I'm allowed to post links to Amazon, but that's where I got them from) with a hydrating toner or essence and to leave it on like a face mask, followed by moisturizer. No scientific support for this one, purely from personal experience:)

**Mild actives** : it is ill-advised to use any actives while taking accutane since they could lead to excessive irritation. However, since I was doing fairly good with moisturizing (never experienced peeling), my skin tolerated mild actives, namely azelaic acid gel (15%), sulfur ointment mask (10 mins), and hypochlorus acid (0.015%; e.g. E11ement, Tower28). Those were not all used at the same time! I'm just listing some milder actives that my skin tolerated pretty well.

* Azelaic gel was actually prescribed by my derm. There are limited case studies reporting the combined usage of azelaic acid and accutane in female adult patients : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9975535/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9975535/) This preliminary study introduced azelaic acid at the last month of accutane treatment and examined the effect of azelaic acid usage post-treatment to deal with scarring and relapse : [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(15)00149-8/](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(15)00149-8/)  
* Sulfur : it has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, also known to be effective against fungal acne. Ive always suspected that some of my acne could be fungal (clusters of closed comedones that sometimes itch) so this one came out while I was researching that. Heres a review : [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15303787/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15303787/) Of note that current guidelines by the American Academy of Dermatology (2024) could not conclude to sufficient evidence to support specific recommendations regarding sulfur : [https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(23)03389-3/](https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(23)03389-3/)
* Hypochorus acid (HOCl): this molecule is naturally produced by our immune system and has antimicrobial properties. It is very well tolerated on sensitive skin and even used to treat dermatitis, so probably the mildest one compared to azelaic and sulfur. This review talks about a study that have found comparable benefits for reducing facial acne between HOCl and benzoyl peroxide, and both effects with HOCl and BP were significantly superior to placebo : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303114/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6303114/)

Finally, I am not a dermatologist, and all studies have their limits (e.g., limited sample size, controlled lab environment). Please communicate with your doctor if your initial break out or side-effects worry you to discuss about potential solutions, especially if you are on a higher dosage. Healthcare professionals have much more clinical experience, so should be valued over the information from this post

I'm only 4 months into my treatment and my dermatologist plan on keeping me at 10mg for another 8 months given that mine was recurrent and stubborn.  I'd be more than happy to share my full experience by then:) Wish you all an amazing day and smooth sailing on your journey to clear skin! "

2023-08-16,1692199836,The Great Purge - Join Me On My Accutane Journey,"Hello all!

I started my Accutane journey on 31/07 so its been just over two weeks now. I do hope Reddit lets me do this. 

For context: Im female, late 20s and receiving treatment in the UK. Ive had trouble with my skin for the past 13 years and have not seen myself with unaffected skin since I was a pre-teen. Ive done the rounds of creams and antibiotics so it was time to finally try the big daddy Isotretinoin. I actually finished a 2-month round of Doxycycline two months before starting on Accutane so this had settled my skin down a little before starting&

Reading other peoples experiences has helped me personally. I figured Id write my journey up on here and update with symptoms. Everyones journey is individual and Im certainly not a medical expert but feel free to comment if youre going through it too, or considering it, or perhaps you stumbled across this randomly and dont know how to leave& we can laugh cry sigh praise together.

Here goes it&

Week One: 

I have 30mg to take daily, its actually in two tablets and one is really tricky to get out the package so I have to look at the scary pregnancy warning for a little longer than I want to lol. No babies, baby!

Symptoms are pretty minimal and manageable. Id prepped myself for Sahara lips and bought shit tonnes of Vaseline as recommended by my derm (who was lovely btw!) but I didnt have issues. Slightly dry nose but that was it. Skin had no visible improvements at this stage, (to be expected) still had cysts around my cheeks/jawline and whiteheads galore. Lovely. Im expecting the purge and will likely lock myself away for 12 hours when it arrives. 

Week Two:

Okay, I see a change. My skin still has breakouts but it has this weird glow to it, which a couple of family members have pointed out. My lips do feel odd, nothing sinister though, they are mildly dry so Vaseline has helped, its not visible to anyone else. My throat is dry. Like no water is enough, I should preface this with I am such a coffee person and I probably will need to up my water intake like now. Inside of my nose is dry now. Overall, its okay so far and Im starting to feel excited to see what my skin will look like. Will I be hawt?

Week Three:

Not much change on last week in terms of symptoms! Mostly dryness, especially lips. I managed to go a week without needing to wash my hair, which used to baffle me when other people said they could do this since Ive always washed mine 1-2 days& overall, feeling okay. I can feel areas prone to blackhead feeling tougher, like small bumps under the skin, I guess cause they are drying out!

Week Four:

Late to update but I had a derm appointment today and my dose has been upped to 60mg. Ive been doing pretty well, lips are chapped still but Ive not had too much change symptom wise. Skin is okay, my back is smooth with no cysts now and Im still waiting for these blackheads to be on their way. This may all change going up in dose so well see. I am well and truly making the most of not having to wash my hair as much = 

Week Five:

Ive done over a week of 60mg now! Generally feeling okay in myself. Eyes and lips are very dry, Ive sacked off contact lenses for the foreseeable.
Ive noticed my skin has thinned out, especially around my hands, arms and feet. Ive got quite a few cuts of nicks around these areas. My acne doesnt seem to have changed too much in the last week or at least, I havent noticed it. Until next week&

Week Six:

A bit late to update here but I went away to the hills for the weekend! Im feeling the effects of 60mg more, my eyes are really sore / dry and my lips are cracked at the sides now. Im applying Carmex so much and then made the mistake of going away without it! I had a breakout towards the end of the last week but its clearing up now and blackheads around my nose are starting to fall out? Sounds weird but its happening = I have another derm appointment tomorrow which came around quickly! Still mentally keeping well. Hows everyone doing?? 

I will update as I go& she says = 

Week 7,8,9,10,11,12 (lol):

So been a while since an update because life be busy lately, but its officially 3 months since I started. A month ago my dose was upped to 70mg which is my max. Since 70mg Ive felt the effects more which is mainly a lot of nosebleeds. I suffered these a lot as a kid& but Ive been having one everyday for a couple of weeks day. Still mentally feeling well, just been feeling physical side effects. More tired and more achey. 

My skin feels like same? Not much change in the last month, not that I notice anyway. Although Ive never had wrinkles before but my forehead cleared and now has lines =

2024-09-05,1725554840,FINALLY DONE!!,"I started Accutane about 8 months ago. At 90 lbs, I was prescribed 80mg daily (40mg twice a day) and took Absorbica LD, which contains fat to enhance isotretinoin absorption.

The only side effect I encountered was dryness, which I managed with my skincare routine and the occasional bloody nose. 
Heres what my skincare routine included:

La Roche-Posay Cleanser (blue bottle)
CosRX Snail Mucin Toner
Lush ""Cosmetic Lad"" and ""Skin Drink""
Various oils: black seed, rosehip, flaxseed
Aquaphor at night to seal everything in

For my lips, I relied solely on Aquaphor, reapplying every two hours. This routine prevented any flaking, peeling, or other skin issues. I wore makeup every day for the first four months and didnt experience any pilling or dryness.

I also took Omega-3s through flaxseed, which I added to my breakfast. This helped me avoid any joint pain or discomfort during the treatment.

Accutane also helped the scar on my cheek heal faster, and it looks significantly better now than when I started. I struggled with my skin during the first few months, especially during the purging phase. I had never experienced acne before last year, which made me stress out about my skin, only making things worse. Now, Im so much more comfortable in my skin, and it feels incredible. Best decision ever.

If you have any questions or need advice, feel free to ask! If youre currently on Accutane, hang in thereits totally worth it. I havent worn makeup in months and feel so much better about my skin now:))",Accutane,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1f9r5cl/finally_done/,1f9r5cl,"FINALLY DONE!! I started Accutane about 8 months ago. At 90 lbs, I was prescribed 80mg daily (40mg twice a day) and took Absorbica LD, which contains fat to enhance isotretinoin absorption.

The only side effect I encountered was dryness, which I managed with my skincare routine and the occasional bloody nose. 
Heres what my skincare routine included:

La Roche-Posay Cleanser (blue bottle)
CosRX Snail Mucin Toner
Lush ""Cosmetic Lad"" and ""Skin Drink""

2021-11-03,1635972487,"Accutane does 4 things to your skin, And you have to understand what the medication does.","I have done 3 courses of Accutane, and this would be my last and most successful one. I am 4 months post Accutane, and I no longer get Cystic Acne, which I thought was impossible, but it happened. 

Accutane does 4 things to your skin, and I want to explain what these 4 things are and how these contribute to Accutane success. Also these 4 things, are what counters the 4 factors you get Acne. You get Acne not because of 1 factor, but usually a combinations of ALL 4. Acne is a skin disease. Just because you have a pimple does not mean you have Acne. Acne is when an individual has been having skin breakouts and infections for an extended periods of time. One or two pimples does NOT mean Acne.

Here are the 4 things Accutane does to your skin. I have done so many years of research, read through many studies, ask dermatologist hundreds of questions to find these answers. I suggest you guys read every single point.

#1. Accutane reduces oil production by shrinking the sebaceous glans(oil gland) within your skin. How this happens is Accutane when taken for a long duration of time, PERMANETLY damages the glands. Yes, it causes permanent damage within the sebaceous gland within your skin. When the meds are taken over a duration of many months, the damage becomes permanent because the Vitamin A within the meds is constantly forcing the gland to not produce oil. Oil mixed with dead skin being turned over is a recipe for infections, or AKA Acne. That is why after your Accutane course, majority of people's skin would not return to post-Accutane levels of oil production. 

#2. Accutane INCREASES skin turn over rate. In a normal person, skin turns over within the span of 4-5 weeks. This means the skin from underneath comes to the surface, pushing away dead skin, or simply your skin renews itself in 4-5 weeks. But your skin isn't a refine machine. Your skin doesn't turn over all at once, some spots on your skin does it slower, some spots does it faster. Accutane speeds this up. How fast? I can't tell exactly. When you are taking Accutane for an extended period of time, your skin will start to turn over faster, and faster, meaning it will renew itself faster. This is GOOD AND BAD. Because like I said, your skin does not turn over all at once, some spots will be slower than the other. Meaning as new skin from underneath, the DEEPEST layers of your skin(Hypodermis) is coming up, dead skin from above layers are not moving up fast enough, and now you have a huge clump of dead skin. And you guys guessed it. Huge clumps of dead skin + oil = purging. Yes, this is one of the major causes of skin purging. The fast turn over rate. That is why over a few months when your skin is all in sync with each other in renewal rate, purging stops because majority of the skin is turning over at the same rate. Imagine a modern car. A car engine has cylinders that combust in an orderly fashion in order to maintain proper speed. Your skin is like the cylinders, except your cylinders are VERY out of sync, one of them is very slow and one of them is very fast causing the engine to malfunction. What this fast turn over does is it basically forces all of your cylinders to turn AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. In hopes of resetting it back to factory settings, and having all of the cylinders to turn in sync again.  

#3. Accutane reduces inflammation. Isotretinoin a form of retinoid is a derivative of Vitamin A. Vitamin A has a role of anti-inflammatory. Remember how I said in the intro, that Acne is usually a combination of all 4 causes of Acne? Inflammation is a huge part of why you get cystic Acne, and why it is red. You see, when your skin is plugged with with dead skin, it isn't a problem actually for most people. The skin will just simply and slowly eject the collagen out in the form of dead skin. But for some people, the body interprets this as a breach in your skin, and treats the dead skin mass as an OUTSIDE intruder trying to breach INTO the skin. When you have a mass of dead skin inside your facial skin, the body does two things, firstly it inflames, which is your body pushing a lot of red blood cells to the infection site, that is why it is so red and bumpy. Now you have a skin infection, or what dermatologist call Acne. Secondly after the pimple has been inflamed for so long, it surfaces and pops. You will notice this white pus. That is your white blood cells trying to eject the dead skin plug. White blood cells are responsible in fighting off infections. Our body is incredible, but not the smartest. Some people's body treats clogged pores as an outside infection and now the clogged pore has a direct stream of fresh red/white blood cells, leading to inflammation. This is one of the most important byproducts of Accutane. You WANT your body to NOT inflame the infection site, because this would lead to cystic Acne. 4 months after Accutane, my skin still gets clogged up, but the benefit is it DOES NOT inflame. Meaning over 1-2 days the bump under my skin simply fades away, and does not break out into the surface, AKA a break out. 

#4. Accutane destroys the P.Acnes bacteria. Of the 4 reason why one has Acne, I would consider this the least probable factor to why one would get Acne. A bacterial infection can lead to Acne. How Accutane stops P.Acnes bacteria from growing on the skin is unknown. 



To end this explanation of the causes of Accutane. I want to everyone to understand this one Fact.
 Accutane is NOT a Acne cure, or treatment. Accutane was initially was made to treat a form of skin cancer, or a type of chemo therapy for skin cancer patients. Scientist and Dermatologist just happened to find that it also treats and prevents Acne very well.

I am not exaggerating when I say I got 1 new pimple every single day for about 6 years. I always said that I would be unstoppable with clear skin, and now I feel it. I was 27 when I began in June 2024. I was on 2 x 10mg Oratane from 25th June to 5th November. 20mg was the most my GP could prescribe. Now I microdose with 10mg every week or so and will continue to do so until I run out.

Side effects: 
Dry skin (I already had very dry skin, so I just lathered on the moisturecastor oil really helped)
Dry lips, like excessively dry, cracked lips (Aquaphor is brilliant)
Heightened cholesterol (I have a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol and as a result, my LDL spiked on Accutane. I cracked down hard and did a high cholesterol diet (high fibre foods, tonnes of veggies and clean protein, no refined sugar or processed food or oils or dairy) which prevented things getting worse BUT DID NOT make them better. I'm due for another blood test when I finish my last pack).
Dry scalp (combated by oiling)

Learning: I wish so hard that I did this earlier. I went almost my entire 20s feeling so shitty about my skin. Isotretinon has saved my skin, saved my confidence, just saved me. Every purge and cracked lip and stint of chest pain (cholesterol related) was worth it. I cannot believe how incredible my results are on such a low dosage.

Now I microdose with 10mg every week or so and will continue to do so until I run out.

Side effects: 
Dry skin (I already had very dry skin, so I just lathered on the moisturecastor oil really helped)
Dry lips, like excessively dry, cracked lips (Aquaphor is brilliant)
Heightened cholesterol (I have a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol and as a result, my LDL spiked on Accutane. I cracked down hard and did a high cholesterol diet (high fibre foods, tonnes of veggies and clean protein, no refined sugar or processed food or oils or dairy) which prevented things getting worse BUT DID NOT make them better. I'm due for another blood test when I finish my last pack).
Dry scalp (combated by oiling)

Learning: I wish so hard that I did this earlier. I went almost my entire 20s feeling so shitty about my skin. Isotretinon has saved my skin, saved my confidence, just saved me. Every purge and cracked lip and stint of chest pain (cholesterol related) was worth it. I cannot believe how incredible my results are on such a low dosage.

Picture 710: November 2024 (finished 2 x 10mg a day and moved to microdosing for cholesterol control AND because I have 0 (ZERO!) active breakouts for the first time in years.

I have spent $xxxxx on skincare products and nothing worked until this. I've been on doxycycline 3 times but it never stuck. I've tried zinc supplements and that helped, but not nearly like this. My skin is finally in a condition where I can effectively use the skincare products I've spent thousands of dollars on. I could not be happier.

Stick with it. Be diligent, monitor your progress, wear your sunscreen, and good luck."

2024-01-28,1706476823,Even VERY low dose Accutane after LASIK FUCKED my eyes,"26 | Male | South Asian

Timeline:

LASIK: 6th Nov, 2023

Started Accutane: 31st December, 2023

Eye symptoms developed: 23rd January, 2024

According to FDA you can't take isotretinoin (accutane) 6 months before or 6 months after LASIK eye surgery. Unfortunately, none of my doctors told me about this. I myself am a doctor but had never studied this and unfortunately had to learn the hard way. 

I have struggled with Acne for nearly 7-8 years now and Isotretinoin was the only thing that had worked for me in the past, albeit always temporarily. I still think it is a wonder drug but this time around it nuked my eyes and I had to stop.

I started my 4th round on accutane, mostly for very mild acne on my forehead that suddenly started to erupt after I travelled to Pakistan from UK in end October. I decided to do 0.1 mg/kg/day bc I wanted to minimise side effects since my acne was very mild and I wanted to go easy on my Liver. 

3 weeks into the treatment, I developed severe orbital pain and for someone who has never had any eye related problems EVER, this was alarming. The pain was so severe I had to take Paracetamol + Ibuprofen and sometimes Tramadol to bring it down. I then began to start reading online about it and began to make the connection with my LASIK 2 months back. 

Both LASIK and Isotretinoin cause dry eyes and can't be done together or within 6 months of each other. Honestly, this might sound crazy but I regret getting LASIK done. Had I known this I wouldn't have gotten LASIK bc getting Lasik may mean that I can potentially never take isotretinoin again. 

Anyways, back to the Dry eyes. 3 weeks into isotretinoin my eyes began to dry the f up. The pain was SO SEVERE and then my entire head would start hurting. I read research that talks about isotret delaying corneal wound healing from lasik and causes atrophy (destruction) of the eye's mebomian glands. 

Now I am literally on 3 kinds of eye drops + Oral Pain killers, praying that I have not developed irreversible corneal damage and mebomian gland destruction, and most scary of all - DED, MGD or corneal neuralgia.

I am sure that isotretinoin was not acting alone. The Inverter (Heating), LASIK and isotret all worked together to wreck my eyes and turn them dryer than a desert. 

I spoke to my Opthamologist today and will see them tomorrow to get my eyes checked and eye glands tested and finally get a diagnosis bc idk what the fuck is happening to my eyes. I hope it turns out as something temp and treatable.

As crazy as this might sound but while I am literally dying of eye pain, I am also completely DEVASTATED that I may have lost my clear skin wonder drug forever.

My advice to anyone taking ACCUTANE or getting LASIK, PLEASE DONT DO THESE TWO TOGETHER. YOU COULD COMPLETELY FUCK YOUR EYES and I'm not talking mild dry eyes, I mean SEVERE DEBILITATING CHRONIC EYE PAIN that nothing fixes. =-

2022-10-02,1664748840,Effect of accutane on the skin microbiome,"Hey everyone, medical provider checking in. I'm not a dermatologist (work in ER) but have been on accutane 4 months now and find the mechanism of accutane pretty fascinating to learn about. 

There was a recent post about low dosing efficacy vs. higher dose/cumulative approach which generated some good discussion. More recent studies seem to indicate that low dose (i.e. 20mg x6 months) can be fairly effective with less side effects, although perhaps a moderately higher rate of relapse. 

My background is in microbiology and I'm equally interested not just in the results of these studies but the *why* \- the mechanism of what accutane is doing exactly to permanently reverse acne. Obviously it stops oil production. But oil by itself doesn't cause acne; it's a complex interaction with the bacteria on the skin. That's why antibiotic courses are often recommended and tried as a first line. Theoretically if you kill the problematic bacteria, you can reverse acne. Topicals and benzoyl peroxide work on roughly the same rationale of nixing the bacteria.

One of the hot topics in health research in the last 10 years has been the microbiome, especially gut bacteria. Everyone has a unique population of a variety of species in their gut.  Changing one's microbiome is a very gradual process. If you want to change your gut, switching to a healthier diet will starve off certain bad bacteria, while reviving the healthy bacteria that were languishing on your diet of Taco Bell and McDonald's. Keep it up for a year or two and your gut microbiome will actually look different. 

Well, skin microbiome is very much a thing too. Many people with acne have an unhealthy/undesirable skin microbiome due to excess oil production - the oil feeds the acne-causing bacteria to the point that they proliferate. If you've had acne for years, these bad bacteria (or yeast in the case of fungal acne) are comfortably settled in and going to be really tough to evict from the neighborhood, so to speak.

Enter accutane - the ultimate starvation diet for oil-loving, acne-causing bacteria. No oil (or very little oil), for months on end. Like a person switching to a healthy diet will change their gut bacteria, a person on accutane changes the diet of their skin bacteria, leading to changes that will (hopefully) become permanent.

This is not my theory by any means, but it is the theory that makes the most sense to me. All that really matters is being on enough accutane to sufficiently dry your skin, and for long enough for those microbiome changes to become permanent.  Once the bad bacteria are really gone and the new healthy bacterial species are established enough, it's okay to stop and turn the oil production back on.

Some dermatologists are embracing the low dose model and making the new benchmark ""clear for X number of months."" I think this makes a lot of sense since if a person is not yet clear, then obviously bad bacteria are still at play. I think the real question is, what is an ideal number of months to continue accutane after clearance in order to solidify the microbiome changes, and what are the rates of relapse if you stop accutane 1 months after you're clear vs 2, 3, 4 months after you're clear, etc. 

Again, I'm not a dermatologist but I do have a background in research &amp; medicine and this theory is  supported by new research in the past 3-4 years. Linking a related article below for those who are interested!

Once the drug has begun to take effect, the symptoms will become prevalent far before the actual noticeable benefits: i.e. dry skin, chapped lips, and extensive purging. Its incredibly important to remember that these things are all part and parcel of being on accutane, and are evidence that the drug is working as expected.

Be careful about everything you say (or don't say, what they elicit) to IPLEDGE.","I completed my first round of Accutane 7 years ago, which was life-changing. I had battled with severe cystic acne for my entire life. The dermatologist had recommended Accutane when I was a teenager but my parents wouldn't allow it due to the medication's reputation.

This year has been both wonderful and tough. I successfully defended my dissertation, was placed in a new city for my doctoral internship, and got engaged. Unfortunately, my placement wound up being across the country from where I was living and required a huge move away from my fiance and best friend. Genetics were shaken up by the stress that I was experiencing and after 7 glorious years of clear skin, acne vulgaris reared its' ugly head with one underground deep scarring pimple popping up after another. I get to play whack-a-mole (or zit) with my face just in time for doctoral graduation photos in May, professional headshots, and future wedding photos! Yikes!

The dermatologist immediately said a second round of Accutane was appropriate as I responded well the first time **with no side effects.** Unfortunately, she could not register me for IPledge because I already had an account from my initial Accutane course. I had to call IPledge and tell them that I needed the account reset and that I needed to change my provider. **That is ALL I needed.**

When I called IPledge, the worker asked me why I needed to reset the account after so many years. I explained that I needed to start a course of Accutane and that I needed to change my provider. She asked if I had taken it before. Of course, I answered yes. **She elicited that information from me**. *She then stated that she needed to report my acne reoccurrence to the FDA and the manufacturer as an adverse reaction to Accutane.* I thought she assumed that I was already taking Accutane. I stated, ""I'm sorry, I'm resetting this IPledge account so that I can START the course of the medication. I am not having an adverse reaction. I haven't had Accutane in my system for 7 years. It's been a stressful year. Stress has a way of working out our worst genetic vulnerabilities. Please don't report my acne as an adverse reaction to Accutane. It isn't. I have NOT taken the medication and am very much looking forward to taking it. I am not having an adverse reaction to Accutane."" She replied, ""I have to report this as an adverse reaction to the FDA and the manufacturer. IT IS MY JOB. I will lose my job if I do not. If you have had Accutane in your system at any time in your life, acne could be an adverse reaction to your previous Accutane course. Anything could be.""

So with that logic, if I have a stomachache now, it could be an adverse reaction to my course of Accutane 7 years ago? What about my headache from dealing with IPledge? It's an adverse reaction alright, but not to the medication itself. With IPledge's logic, it could be!

**These IPledge workers cannot connect two neurons together.**

I now have the manufacturer calling me and asking me to fill out forms stating that I did not have an adverse reaction to Accutane. I now have to take time that I don't have in my schedule to do this extra step. To make matters even better, the genius IPledge worker who was quick to elicit information and report it when it really wasn't her information to report, provided the manufacturer with the wrong DOB so I cannot verify my identity. IPledge has to go back and fix their report so that I can rectify the information with the manufacturer.

I'm angry. I haven't even been able to start my medication yet because I have to wait 30 days and prove that I am not pregnant when I have an IUD.

I have managed not to get pregnant throughout my entire life. I think I can handle 6 more months while I'm on Accutane.

I'm angry because that was not their information to report. It is MY healthcare information and I should choose what gets reported and what does not, especially if it is benign. **They took my autonomy away.** It feels like IPledge just immediately assumes maleficence and ignorance of the patients taking Accutane.

Do you realize they regulate Accutane more heavily than they regulate narcotics? It is all about controlling women. How about we put the rights of the patient first rather than a potential fetus? Do you realize that we didn't regulate opiates this heavily? Maybe if we had, there wouldn't be such a huge opiate crisis now. Do you know they haven't thoroughly studied the impacts of isotretinoin on sperm? They say it isn't ""entirely known,"" but men no longer have to make an account on IPledge. Why isn't the termination of a pregnancy presented as a viable option? You don't have to believe in it or do it, but why isn't it even in the options? 

I called IPledge and spoke to a manager. I genuinely wonder what motivates someone to get a job at IPledge. Do they realize how difficult IPledge makes it for doctors and their patients? Have they read the literature on the program being ineffective and on average there are still about 170 pregnancies on Accutane a year? That number hasn't changed since the implementation of the IPledge program. You'd think the FDA would evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. Do these workers not have any authority in their own lives and cling to the little piece they obtain at work? Do they get jobs working there because they feel motivated by their views? Healthcare should be objective.

The IPledge manager told me that they report everything other than basic conversation to the FDA and the manufacturer. They even report positive effects of the medication. If I said ""Accutane worked for me,"" they'd report that. She stated that it was for ""research purposes."" I stated that reporting an adverse reaction of acne to a drug that I haven't taken in 7 years is a pretty poor research practice. Firstly it's wrong. Secondly, it's a direct link from one variable to another. It's causal and makes very poor assumptions. Thirdly, it does not take my stressors or genetic vulnerability into account so it does not provide a clear picture of what is happening. Shouldn't good research provide a snapshot of what is happening in real life?

Luckily, the doctor states that the only person that can stop me from taking the medication is her.

The moral of the story is that you need to be careful even when simply saying ""yes,"" or ""no,"" to what seems like an innocuous question from IPledge. Send smoke signals or blink once for yes, twice for no to them if you can. Looking back I would have said, ""I just need the account reset please.""",Accutane,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1g7q0fi/ipledge_rant_and_warning_be_careful_about/,1g7q0fi,"IPledge Rant and WARNING! Be careful about everything you say (or don't say, what they elicit) to IPLEDGE. I completed my first round of Accutane 7 years ago, which was life-changing. I had battled with severe cystic acne for my entire life. The dermatologist had recommended Accutane when I was a teenager but my parents wouldn't allow it due to the medication's reputation.

This year has been both wonderful and tough. I successfully defended my dissertation, was placed in a new city for my doctoral internship, and got engaged. Unfortunately, my placement wound up being across the country from where I was living and required a huge move away from my fiance and best friend.

2024-11-02,1730573598,The End - And the start of learning to be confident,"FOR ALL STRUGGLING:

I began isotretinoin November 2023 at 14 years old, with a perscribed dose of 20 mg/day. Ive always had bad skin, it all started when I was 12, but as you do at such a young age, I did not care for my appearance whatsoever, which just resulted in my acne getting worse and worse. 

After the first month I had not experienced any side effects except for the standard dry skin and lips. I got my dose upped to 20mg/day and 40mg/day alternating every day. It is also around this time I started purging, purging&. This took a great toll on my confidence, looks were never really my strong suit with all of the acne, and isotretinoin just made it worse. Thank God however it did not harm my liver in any way. 

And it got worse, and worse, and worse.  The first two pictures were from when my acne was at its abseloute worst in Jan/Feb/March of 2024. My dermatologist originally told me that I should expect everything to start clearing up after around 3-4 months, and seeing it just get worse was extremely discouraging. I think everybody here can relate to the feeling of being surronded by people with exceptionally clear skin, and being the outsider. My dermatologist had also perscribed me a clindoxyl (If I remember) cream, which is an extremely harsh topical cream with 5% benzoyl peroxide, which is the one thing you do not under any circumstance give to a patient on isotretinoin. This predictably resulted in more irritation, inflammation and destroyed my skin barrier. 

One especially tough episode sticks out to me. I had two moisturizers which Ive occasionally used together. One was a combination of a moisturizer and sunscreen (SPF 50) and the other was a normal moisturizer. My skin was exceptionally dry this day, so I decided just to put on both& Big mistake. My faced burned like it never has, it lasted for over 8 hours and I couldnt bare to be in the sun, mind you this was a school trip to Prague so we had to be outside all day. 

This was perhaps my encounter with the so called terrible side effects of isotretinoin. 

I also decided on my own to go against the advice of my dematologist and start taking 60 mg/day instead of 40 as perscribed. 
Do not ever do this. It can damage your liver greatly, and there is a reason we have monthly bloodwork. I am very fortunate thank God, that this did not do any damage, but it can. 

Then came April, and I noticed my some of my acne was now just scars with PIE (Post Inflammatory Erythema). It still looked terrible, but it was not all big pimples. It continued like this, slowly but surely. A big milestone for me was now being able to hide some of it with concealer and foundation. 

It got better, month by month. 

July 13th 2024, I took my last dose of accutane, with no acne left at all. Just scars and inflammation, but that was somewhat easily hideable by using foundation/concealer. 

Just a couple of weeks ago, I got my first CO2 treatment targeting the scars. I have 2 more treatments left, but for me this is the end. 

All that is left now is for me to learn to have confidence in how I look. The greatest challenge of acne has been the insecurity Ive felt, and which still persists to this day. I am never satisfied with my skin fully, but Ive learnt to accept it and slowly but surely getting more confident. 

I wish the best for everyone taking isotretinoin right now. It is abseloutely terrible to endure, but it will work, and I am extremely thankful to have been on this medication.

2019-07-21,1563708146,MAINTENANCE AFTER ACCUTANE,"So I have been off of accutane for about 6 to 7 months now. I had hormonal somewhat cystic acne (also plenty of comedones) and I was on a 5 month course of isotretinoin (40mg for 2 months, 60mg for 3 months) or something along those lines.

I have had a total of , if Im being honest, one cystic spot in 7 months and it was a reddish mark that faded away within a day or so with benzoyl peroxide. While this is a feat many dream of and Im probably not grateful enough, I am writing to this sub to express one crucial thing:

DONT BE TOO COMPLACENT.

Maintenance is crucial; accutane counteracts your crazy genes and oil production but truth be told, those acne bacterium still linger. So, heres my top 3 tips for maintenance.

NUMBER ONE: DIFFERIN
- Absolutely necessary, no question. This should be compulsory by dermatologists tbh. It is a topical form of vitamin A, or as some would say, topical accutane, hence why its called tretinoin. This will keep your face clear by exfoliating dead skin cells, and help eliminate comedones. Every night I suggest applying around a pea size, and use a moisturiser to buffer ! (Put moisturiser on before differin to reduce dryness; doesnt impact effectiveness).

NUMBER TWO: BENZOYL PEROXIDE
- Some call it contact therapy, some call it a wash, I call it magic. Every morning (and night if not effective enough) apply benzoyl peroxide to your face, but heres the catch: only for 2 minutes minimum, 10 minutes max. The sweet spot for me is around 3-5 minutes, but this is for you to experiment. In this time, benzoyl peroxide already kills acne bacteria through the oxygen introduced to the pores, making its environment toxic for bacteria. But since you wash it off, no dryness/peeling occurs, so you essentially cheat the system. Yes it sounds too good to be true , thats why its magic !

NUMBER THREE: WASH AND MOISTURISE
- Bruh this is a must. My routine includes benzoyl peroxide for 3-5 minutes, simple face wash, simple moisturiser, and simple sunscreen (throw in aloe Vera and hyaluronic acid for extra moisture). 

So there you have it. Make sure to not become complacent !

BONUS: By taking that extra step, a few things can change in your life, such as:
- Not having plans revolve around when your skin looks best 
- Not having to feel guilty every time you touch dairy
- Not caring about what you eat
- Waking up in the morning and not counting new spots
- Waking up in the morning with the expectation of clear skin
- Higher self esteem

But as someone who has seen both sides, here are the negatives !:
- Your lips and skin will probably be more dry post accutane (not as bad as during)
- Youll begin to realise that people truly did not care about your skin as much as you thought they did and that only those who judged you really were insecure themselves and it wasnt just a cheesy line to make you feel better it was the genuine truth and that you may begin to realise that everything you turned down because of your skin was a complete waste because in reality there was nothing stopping you from doing it and no you do not immediately get a girlfriend/boyfriend or more friends in fact people began to talk to me less and I received a total number of one compliment which included nice skin further emphasising the fact that the only people who care about your acne is people with acne and it does not cure your depression or anxiety it will only highlight that youve been deflecting your neural issues onto imperfections making self criticism more rampant due to there being no clear answer to your issues so the only true social benefit to it all is that you no longer have to worry about a spot bursting mid conversation and having to excessively dab the area with your sleeve even though its been an hour and it cant possibly still be bleeding",Accutane,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/cfy03a/maintenance_after_accutane/,cfy03a,"MAINTENANCE AFTER ACCUTANE So I have been off of accutane for about 6 to 7 months now.

2024-10-22,1729632375,General Experience - Female - 28 - UK - 40mg,"Hey everyone, I'm just over halfway through my course and just wanted to write up my experiences and some infomation so far for anyone similar as this really helped me at the beginning of the course...

My skin has been up and down for about 15 years, I'm sure you've heard it all before! Same old story of trying everything but at the beginning of this year it really went downhill. I tried lymacycline for a few months but it did nothing so I finally decided to bite the bullet and try accutane.

I read a lot of horror stories when I was younger and had been putting it off for years, all I can say is I wish I'd started it earlier, it's really been a miracle. If you're reading this and you're unsure, just give it a go you can always come off it if you don't like it.

I'm very lucky..Isotretinoin just jels with my body, i barely have any side effects at all other than dry lips, not even my skin is dry it's just...normal. My skin and hair are usually super super oily so my derm said that it's normal for people with really oily skin to not experience severe dryness.

In the UK (I don't know if this is the same as other countries) you have a target dose OR 2 months without producing a new spot, whichever comes first.

In my case my target dose is 8500mg ish. I started on 20mg a day and then upped to 40mg and then had the option to up again to 70mg which is the max for my weight. However, upping from 40mg to 70mg made a huge difference to the side effects IMO. I was super lethargic, my joints hurt, I had headaches all the time...40mg is perfect I hardly notice it, it's what I'm still taking now. My starting weight wad 71kg and I now weigh 66kg so I'm quite happy staying on a lower dose.

My derm agrees with the consensus that it's better to take a lower dose for a longer amount of time to increase the chances of success! If I had it my way I'd honestly never come off it haha.

Some quick points to cover the things I was super nervous about before I started:

- the purge is difficult, yes. But I was already so depressed from my acne that it was like a drop in the ocean

- taking an Antihistamine with your accutane really helps with the redness

- my cholesterol is higher but thats normal and will go back down after the end of the course. I've been cutting down on fat anyway

- I've been in the sun and been on many holidays. Have just been very liberal with my suncream and everything's been fine!

- I am someone who drinks a lot of water anyway but I just make sure I take a huge bottle round with me everywhere!

in terms of products, I was using tretinoin 0.1% before this (after working my way up to that strength for over a year) but i stopped absolutely every topical when I started accutane. Now I just use cerave moisturising face wash and cerave Moisturiser + 50 spf. Same every morning and every evening.

The photos are from the day I started and then monthly until just now, (June 22nd - October 22nd). My derm predicted 6 months but as I've been taking a lower dose, and I have skipped a couple of days here and there it'll more likely be 8/9 months which is more than okay with me!

Sorry this was a bit of a brain dump but I was OBSESSED with reading through everyone's posts and trying to gather as much info as possible when I started so I thought it might be helpful to someone, I know It can be a really lonely time d

2021-01-12,1610479661,A post of reassurance: Accutane side effects are *TEMPORARY*!!! (I asked 10 dermatologists!) Eff you Chadturnedincel.,"Hey guys ! good news for anyone who was harassed or fear-mongered by this jacka\*\*, u/chadturnedincel who has been fearmongering us into thinking that 10% (or something like that) of people have permanent side effects from accutane. IT ISN'T TRUE!!!

LOOK HERE --&gt; The American Academy of Dermatology itself has stated that there are a lot of myths about accutane and reassures us to knw that the side effects are TEMPORARY (not permanent!) [https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/derm-treat/isotretinoin/side-effects](https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne/derm-treat/isotretinoin/side-effects) 

This is a myth, started by lame losers who want to scare us. This myth isn't supported by the medical community at all!

When I first started getting harassed by chadturnedincel and also some freak on instagram who told me that side effects are commonly permanent and that accutane is poison, I totally lost my shit and it sent me into one of the darkest periods of my life. I started reaching out and messaging multiple well-known and certified dermatologists (about 10 of them!) who ALL TOLD ME THAT SIDE EFFECTS ARE TEMPORARY.

It's possible that very rarely (maybe 1/100,000 or something) someone may have permanent damage but this is far from the norm and it is DEFINITELY not 1 in 10 people as chad has tried to fear us into thinking.

Be reassured. Accutane is safe. Stick with it, you guys are doing something good for your skin and as long as you listen to your doctor and follow the prescription, you will be totally ok!

Love you all!

2024-04-04,1712257086,On Accutane for 5 years without knowing it,"28M here  
  
So the title sounds ridiculous, trust me I know. Here's what happened - 5 years ago in 2019, I was having mild-moderate issues with acne on my face. I went to a dermatologist and he prescribed me with a salicylic cleanser and 'vitamin A' tablets two times a week. Upon prodding him on what exactly 'vitamin A' was, and I recall this conversation clearly, he mentioned it was "" a supplement that will help reduce the oil in your skin"". He warned me that it could cause lip dryness and advised me to apply lip balm. When I made payment, the pills were labeled ORT on the front label.

After taking it twice a week for some months, my acne had reduced so the dosage was reduced to once a week. And I've been taking that dosage for the last... 5 years. Recently I've been struggling with dryness in multiple places. My cheeks which has caused peeling, my lips which are always chapped and peeling, and my penis which has been dry, peeling, and red (painful to the touch). I started looking at my routine and when I looked at my unassuming 'vitamin A', the back of the silver tablet pack says 'Oratrane, Isotretinoin, 10mg'. Basically Oratrane is just a different brand of Accutane, which I would have known about if my derm had told me.

I've been taking Accutane, a drug known to have many side effects for 5 YEARS without any of the potential issues such as liver damage, dry-eye, potential blindness (wtf?) communicated to me.

I've taken a cumulative dosage of 3k+ mgs over these past 5 years. I'm honestly quite terrified as to the long term impact this will have on my health. Will the dryness overall (including my penis) subside once I stop taking the accutane or is there a risk it will sustain for the rest of my life? Are there any more issues that I should be wary of with my health? Are there tests I should go and undertake to rule out some of these issues?

I know - it's pretty stupid that I never made the 'vitamin A' to Accutane connection. But honestly I'm shocked by how unethical my derm is with this treatment course. I just have some burning questions that I hope the community can help to answer. Thanks in advance.",Accutane,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accutane/comments/1bvvh2b/on_accutane_for_5_years_without_knowing_it/,1bvvh2b,"On Accutane for 5 years without knowing it 28M here

2024-05-28,1716929614,Report Accutane low dose (20mg) - My course &amp; unexpected side effects,"Hi,

I (woman 28 yo, 50kg) have finished a course of 8 months of low dose Accutane (20mg a day) and after having spent MONTHS reading the various contributions of redditors, I would like to summarize my own experience and unexpected side effects in case this would be helpful for others

***\*\**** ***Initial state of my skin and dose \*\****

Moderate to severe acne (approximately 10-15 inflammed spots on my face on average), lots of dark spots on the nose ; a few rolling scars. Prescribed dose was 20mg a day for 8 months.

***\*\* Summary - Effect on acne  \*\****

Very happy with the treatment which worked wonders with my acne. No purge (I was lucky). I could see after 2-3 weeks that I had less new acne coming and that the inflammatory acne already existing faded faster (the acne itself, not the PIH). On month 2 it was already very obvious that 80% of the acne had reduced and none was left by the 4th month apart from one very small spot here and there (very rarely). Everything totally disappeared by 6 months

***\*\**** ***Side effects which I expected  \*\****

* **Dryness**: during the entire course: dry lips (first side effect, happend 8 days into the treatment), a little bit of dry eyes,  dry skin and particularly the skin of my hands (little red rashes). Aquaphor Gel was my best friend
* **Good hair**: no greasy hair at all, more volume, more shiny and easier to tame. Oh I miss the Accutane hair!
* Also, I had **dry scalp** during the 1st month but doing some masks with a mix of almond and argan oil every week was very efficient for me. This may explain why my hair was healthier.
* I was really **tired the first month** but fortunately it went better afterwards and I could keep practicing sports
* **some kind of** **joint pain** (?) in my heels, as if those were a little bit strained, which lasted the first 3 months but which I only felt when standing up after being seated. Based on the advice of some redditors, I took collagene powder every morning to help with joint pain starting from month 3 and I don't know whether this helped or whether the joint pain would have disappeared by itself.
* **Increase of bad cholesterol** as shown by blood test every months: based on some redditors' advice here and my derm instructions, I decided to take some Omega3 every day starting from month 3. It worked! The blood tests improved after I started doing it.
* **Mood swings**: I was lucky that i avoided all signs of depression, but I did have a few mood swings in the course of those 8 months, in particular in the first 2-3 months. Those were quite brief and not very serious but I could feel there was something a bit different (more ""hormonal""?) in the way I was feeling things and reacting.
* **Sun sensitivity:** I was EXTREMELY cautious and wore spf every time there was more than 3 UV index. Still I got quite red and minor sun burnt twice in my cheeks just because I walked 15 minutes in the sun (moderate UV) without wearing a SPF. (Note that I am white but I have no particular sun sensitivy when not taking Accutane).
* **Scars heal more slowly:** while the inflammation of the acne was much shorter, the PIH stayed longer than usual (probably because my skin was dehydrated). I did not mind : I kept hydrating with creams and the PIH eventually disappeared entirely within 6-8 months

***\*\**** ***Side effects I did not expect  \*\****

I have to admit that there were many side effects that I did not expect, despite my many readings on the subject:

* **Better appearance of rolled scars** due to my skin being more tight during the course. This advantage has disappeared after finishing the course when my skin got back to its normal tightness. Still it made me feel prettier while it lasted
* **Periods**: my periods, which had been very regular for YEARS, started becoming really strange and irregular starting from the 2nd month (coming for 2 days then disappearing for 6 weeks, then 3 very light days, then disappearing again for 2 weeks, coming back etc.). Important note: I did not take any hormones or oral contraceptive during the course  and the only change in my life was taking Accutane. Those irregularities stopped approximately 2 months after I finished the course of Accutane.  Derm said that I was not the first lady who reported this side effect to him.
* **Fine lines** around the month and the eyes (I had none before the treatment): this effect annoyed me because I really thought ""am I getting rid of acne to replace it with prematured wrinkles?"" and ""isotretinoin is supposed to have an anti aging effect so wtf?"". I could literrally see lines appearing on my face during the course of Accutane. My derm kept telling this was obvious deshydration as I did not drink enough water (I was supposed to drink 2,5L but I struggle doing 1,5L) and not to worry as those would fade after the end of the course. I am happy to say that now it is better, they are still a bit visible but they are fading indeed.... we will see how it goes.
* the **ACCUTANE NOSE**, as some people in this sub seem to call it: I had never heard of this effect before being at least until 5 months into the treatment. I normally have a small nose but on month 5, I started to notice there was something weird with it as if it was TOO thin (in a bad way in my case). Several relatives also asked me if I did something to it. None of us suspected Accutane until I saw a post on reddit about the Accutane nose. So... yep, I can confirm this is definitely a thing at least for me (and in my situation it was not a good thing esthetically speaking).
* **Minor nose bleeding** between month 6 and month 8 (no huge amount of blood but still a little bit once avery 3-4 days). Derm said this was a common side effect and told me to gently put Aquaphor Gel with a Qtip inside my nostrils.
* **Sweating**: ok, so I am usually a person who sweats VERY little including during sport. I can run 3 hours and my feet will be totally dry in my shoes. Anyway, I noticed very quickly during the 1st month of Accutane that I was sweating SIGNIFICANTLY more at the gym, with sweat literally pouring down my nose and my neck. This may be a strange thing to say but... I kinda enjoyed it :D. I loved the idea of having water coming through my pores, it made me feel as if my body was breathing or something, I don't know how to explain it. And this gave me the look of a warrior :D. Well, in any case: I kept sweating like this for the entire course of Accutane, maybe slightly less after 5 months; and after stopping Accutane I stopped sweating and got back to my normal self. Derm told me this was a very common side effect (how come I never heard of it ???).
* **Lowered drinking resistance**: I have been drinking very little during the course due to the warnings made by my derm (""you can drink but only in a very reasonable way, no more than once a week""). I respected the instructions but I still could feel that I was getting drunk much faster (like one glass of wine vs 3 usually).
* **High libido**: I felt very early in the course that my libido was higher. I think that getting rid of this horrible acne made me feel better in my head, happier and sexier (and therefore want to fornicate). This was still a good surprise because I expected the accutane tiredness and dryness to reduce my libido and it actually improved it (and it did not impact at all the ability to lubricate - if I may say it bluntly). Of course I was EXTREMELY prudent with contraceptives to avoid any pregnancy for obvious reasons.
* **Incompatibility with beard**: I know this sounds ridiculous, but kissing my husband became uncomfortable for me due to his beard irritating the skin of my chin, very sensitive due to Accutane. (So... more sex, less kisses.. sigh). It is now back to normal.

***\*\* And now  \*\****

I (woman 28 yo, 50kg) have finished a course of 8 months of low dose Accutane (20mg a day) and after having spent MONTHS reading the various contributions of redditors, I would like to summarize my own experience and unexpected side effects in case this would be helpful for others

***\*\**** ***Initial state of my skin and dose \*\****

Moderate to severe acne (approximately 10-15 inflammed spots on my face on average), lots of dark spots on the nose ; a few rolling scars. Prescribed dose was 20mg a day for 8 months.

***\*\* Summary - Effect on acne  \*\****

Very happy with the treatment which worked wonders with my acne. No purge (I was lucky). I could see after 2-3 weeks that I had less new acne coming and that the inflammatory acne already existing faded faster (the acne itself, not the PIH). On month 2 it was already very obvious that 80% of the acne had reduced and none was left by the 4th month apart from one very small spot here and there (very rarely). Everything totally disappeared by 6 months

***\*\**** ***Side effects which I expected  \*\****

* **Dryness**: during the entire course: dry lips (first side effect, happend 8 days into the treatment), a little bit of dry eyes,  dry skin and particularly the skin of my hands (little red rashes). Aquaphor Gel was my best friend
* **Good hair**: no greasy hair at all, more volume, more shiny and easier to tame. Oh I miss the Accutane hair!
* Also, I had **dry scalp** during the 1st month but doing some masks with a mix of almond and argan oil every week was very efficient for me. This may explain why my hair was healthier.
* I was really **tired the first month** but fortunately it went better afterwards and I could keep practicing sports
* **some kind of** **joint pain** (?) in my heels, as if those were a little bit strained, which lasted the first 3 months but which I only felt when standing up after being seated.

2024-05-26,1716740175,Why You Definitely Shouldn't Drink on Accutane,"**Introduction**

Alcohol has always served as a powerful social lubricant, giving a temporary escape from feelings of self consciousness and introversion. This can make a particularly attractive crutch for those already feeling shy and inhibited by severe cystic acne. Whilst Accutane offers a permanent solution for severe acne, it can still feel tempting to reach out for alcohol during treatment  despite the strong words of warning from doctors. In this article Ill explain why you should definitely fight this temptation, and heed the doctors warnings.

**Key points:**

* Isotretinoin is a slightly modified version of retinoic acid which is naturally produced by the body using enzymes including ALDHs.
* By administering Isotretinoin, which converts into retinoic acid, the enzymes the body uses to naturally synthesise retinoic acid become downregulated.
* This is likely on account of a negative feedback loop to counter the excessive retinoic acid signalling that during treatment with the acne drug.
* These enzymes dont just play a role in making retinoic acid but also are key for de-toxification. Particularly ALDH2, which breaks down the harmful product of alcohol called Acetaldehyde.
* Acetaldehyde is the cause of hangover and the many of the nasty effects of Alcohol consumption.
* By downregulating these detoxifying enzymes, Accutane puts a patient in a uniquely compromised position, and so alcohol should be strictly prohibited during treatment.

 

**ALDH is needed for Alcohol metabolism**

Isotretinoin is a retinoid, which means it is related to Vitamin A. It essentially works as a pro-drug for the main metabolite of Vitamin A called Retinoic Acid. Isotretinoin is simply a modified version of retinoic acid, which can be easily converted to retinoic within cells**. In fact, Isotretinoin avoids stimulating a response from the enzymes (P450) that would other metabolise high doses of retinoic acid if administered directly.** \[1\] This simple process bypasses all the enzymes that the body uses to naturally synthesise retinoic acid from dietary sources of retinol. [To learn more about how Accutane works in the body, read here.](https://secondlifeguide.com/2023/11/05/what-causes-post-accutane-syndrome/)

Retinoic Acid is typically produced in the body in a two-stage process. First retinol is converted to retinal with enzymes called Alcohol/retinol dehydrogenases (ADH/RDH), and then retinal is oxidised to retinoic acid with the different Aldehyde Dehydrogenase (ALDH) isoforms expressed in different tissues**. Its these ALDH enzymes that are so critical for understanding the effect of alcohol consumption during Accutane treatment.** They are a diverse family of enzymes with a broad spectrum of roles outside of the production of retinoic acid  from maintaining vision to generating neurosteroids.

**The function of ALDH enzymes which is perhaps best well known is in their de-toxifying effect, breaking down reactive aldehydes to much less harmful metabolites.** Specifically, ALDH2, which oxidises acetaldehyde into the much less harmful acetic acid. **Acetaldehyde is the toxic product of alcohol consumption which contributes to the negative symptoms of hangover**. Mutations on the gene for ALDH2 can mean that some East Asian populations are especially susceptible the toxic effects of alcohol, colloquially referred to as **Asian Flush**. \[2\]

 

**Accutane downregulates ALDH**

**Theres accumulating evidence to show that treatment with Isotretinoin causes these ALDH enzymes to downregulate**. This isnt surprising as negative feedback loops are often used throughout the body in an attempt to achieve homeostasis. The excessive retinoic acid signalling that occurs during Accutane treatment likely triggers a repression of the enzymes involved in the natural synthesis of retinoic acid, including ALDH. \[3\]\[4\] **By marking ALDH enzymes for repression, Isotretinoin boosts the presence of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).** This makes it a remarkably useful conjunctive in treating cancer, by enhancing the toxic effects of chemo drugs. \[5\]\[6\]

**Whilst Reactive Oxygen Species are harmful to cancers, they are also harmful for healthy tissue too**. Asian Flush may seem like a novelty, but mutations on the ALDH2 enzyme can have dire implications for diseases driven by oxidative stress such as Alzheimers. \[7\] [To better understand the implications of Isotretinoin on the brain, read this article.](https://secondlifeguide.com/2024/04/28/accutane-dopamine-restoring-the-reward-system/) One of the standard treatment protocols of Alcoholism is using ALDH2 inhibitors such as Disulfiram. By promoting the presence of toxic aldehydes in the blood following binge drinking, alcohol becomes far less rewarding and encourages the patient to quit.  

 

**Conclusion**

Given the oxidative stress induced by alcohol consumption, it should be avoided during a course of Accutane treatment. Just three months of Accutane treatment dramatically increases oxidative markers in the blood. \[8\] **By repressing the activity of key ALDH enzymes, Isotretinoin puts a patients in an especially compromised position**. \[9\]

#Efficacy of low-dose isotretinoin in acne vulgaris
by Kabir Sardana, Vijay K Garg

&gt;Our analysis of the data revealed that the efficacy and relapse rates of low-dose isotretinoin in mild to moderate grades of acne is comparable with the standard regimen (1 mg/kg/day), which is given in the severe grade of acne vulgaris.

&gt;Thus, the grade of acne vulgaris should dictate the dose of administration of isotretinoin and the standard dose of 1 mg/kg/day is an unnecessary overtreatment for mild to moderate grades of acne. 

My takeaway : 0.5 mg/kg/day dosage to treat mild to moderate grades of acne is as effective 1 mg/kg/day.

#Is less more with isotretinoin and acne?
by Gurkirti Brar, Parbeer Grewal and Christina Korownyk

&gt;Studies show that acne improvement with low-dose (about 20 mg/d) isotretinoin is similar to that with conventional doses

&gt;Low-dose isotretinoin might reduce common side effects by 16% to 35%; it might also be associated with higher relapse rates, particularly with severe acne, possibly owing to lower total accumulated doses.

My takeaway : A fixed dosage of 20 mg/daily is effective and severity of side-effects are reduced. Higher relapse for severe acne if the cumulative dose is not achieved.

#Efficacy of fixed daily 20 mg of isotretinoin in moderate to severe scar prone acne
by Abbas Rasi,Elham Behrangi, Masoumeh Rohaninasab,and Zahra Mehr Nahad

&gt;At the end of treatment course, (96.4%) demonstrated complete clearing of their acne, defined as no acne or occasional isolated lesions.

&gt;In 5-year follow-up, relapse accrued in 11 (7.9%) of patients. All adverse effects were mild, and discontinuation of treatment was not necessary.

&gt;The most common side-effects were mild cheilitis in 93 patients (66.4%), mild xerosis in 12 patients (8.5%), epistaxis in 4 (2.8%), and arthralgia in 5 patients (4.2%), respectively. Six patients excluded the study because of complications such as depression (in 3 patients), Melena, severe arthralgia and severe headache. Adverse effects were higher in male patients (30.3%) versus 17.6% in females, but there was not statistically significant difference (0.071).

&gt;Low dose isotretinoin was found to be a safe and effective choice for patients with moderate to severe scar prone acne vulgaris.

&gt;The only pitfall is it is longer than 10 months duration of treatment period. 

Side-effects during the study : https://i.imgur.com/GZuoaFL.png

My takeaway : A 20mg/day dose is safe as the advert effects are mild and effective. Side-effects are dose dependent.
The relapse rate is also low after 5 year. They don't mention what they mean by relapse. One of the most complete paper I've seen. Highly recommend to read.

#Low-dose schema of isotretinoin in acne vulgaris  
by Mandekou-Lefaki, F Delli, A Teknetzis, R Euthimiadou, G Karakatsanis

&gt;Sixty-four patients (35 women and 29 men) with different types and grades of acne vulgaris were divided into two treatment groups of 32 patients, in a trial that compared a low dose of 0.15-0.40 mg/kg per day with a high dose of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg per day

&gt;The mean success rate of the low-dose schema was 69%.

&gt;The total dose up to 120 mg/kg should be followed for optimal results (success rate of 91%) and avoidance of relapses

&gt;The low-dose schema produced fewer adverse effects and offered a very beneficial effect on pre-existing scarring

&gt;We recommend a total dose &gt; or = 120 mg/kg, as this therapeutic regimen of isotretinoin has proven to be the most successful in preventing relapses and scarring

My takeaway : Succes rate seems low, they didn't mention the severity of patient's acne. If you want higher success rate, the standard total dose as to be followed, resulting a longer treatment.

#Comparing the Efficacy of Low Dose and Conventional Dose of Oral Isotretinoin in Treatment of Moderate and Severe Acne Vulgaris 
by Gita Faghihi, Fatemeh Mokhtari, Nasrin Motamedi Fard, Narges Motamedi, Sayed Mohsen Hosseini

&gt;This study was conducted to compare the effect of low-dose isotretinoin with its conventional dose in patients with moderate and severe acne. 

&gt;The patients were divided into two treatment groups: 0.5 mg/kg/day isotretinoin capsule and low-dose isotretinoin capsule (0.25 mg/kg/day)

&gt;Patients in both groups received 6-month treatment.

&gt;The average severity of acne in the two treatment groups did not differ significantly within any of the study periods.

&gt;The most common side effects were nose dryness in the low-dose group (17%) and hair thinning and loss in the conventional-dose group (33.2%), although all the patients had dry lips. 

My takeaway : The two groups had the same acne but at lower dose, fewer side effects leading to a better patient's satisfaction were seen.

#Efficacy of Oral Low-Dose Isotretinoin in the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris in Vietnam 
by Thanh Le Thai Van, Phuong Nguyen Minh, Phuong Tran Thi Thuy, Marco Gandolfi, Francesca Satolli, Claudio Feliciani, Michael Tirant, Aleksandra Vojvodic, Torello Lotti

&gt;We conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the effectiveness of the low-dose therapy on the plasma homocysteine and serum folic acid level of 52 acne patients after 6-8-week treatment at University Medical Center Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam

&gt;With a low dose of oral isotretinoin (0.37 ± 0.11 mg/kg/day), after 6-8-week treatment, patients dropped the severity of disease, increased the plasma homocysteine level and decreased the serum folic acid level with significant differences in comparison to those before treatment.

&gt;In overall, low dose isotretinoin treatment had effectiveness in decrease the severity of disease and no increasing the plasma homocysteine level as well as the serum folic acid level.

My takeaway : Lower dose is effective to treat acne. There's a decrease in serum folic acid and increase in plasma homocysteine, maybe thats why blood test are important.

#The use of isotretinoin in low doses and unconventional treatment regimens in different types of acne: a literature review
by Jolanta D. Torzecka,corresponding author1 Bo|ena Dziankowska-Bartkowiak, Zofia Gerlicz-Kowalczuk and Anna Wozniacka1

&gt;We conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the effectiveness of the low-dose therapy on the plasma homocysteine and serum folic acid level of 52 acne patients after 6-8-week treatment at University Medical Center Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam

&gt;Our results suggest that the proposed intermittent low-dose therapy with isotretinoin is preferred by the patients, which is proved by patients with recurrences being willing to repeat the therapy.

&gt;Although high doses of isotretinoin are recognized as a standard treatment, on the other hand, a number of clinical studies indicate that in most patients with a moderate form of acne, lower dosage of the drug is sufficient to achieve improvement and what is most important is safer because of significantly fewer side effects.

#Safety and Efficacy of Low-Dose Isotretinoin in the Treatment of Moderate to Severe Acne Vulgaris
by Jolanta D. Torzecka,corresponding author1 Bo|ena Dziankowska-Bartkowiak, Zofia Gerlicz-Kowalczuk and Anna Wozniacka1

&gt;50 participants, both male and female, having moderate to severe acne vulgaris were enrolled and treated with isotretinoin at a dose of 20 mg/day (approximately 0.3-0.4 mg/kg/day), for a period of 3 months

&gt;At the end of the treatment, very good results were observed in 90% of participants

&gt;Cheilitis was the most common among the side effects observed and was seen in 98% of the participants

&gt;One participant developed vitiligo as a side effect

&gt;Elevated serum lipid levels were observed in 6% of the participants, and relapse occurred in 4% of the participants over a 6 month follow up period.

My takeaway : For a short period of treatment at low dose, isotretinoin is effective to treat moderate to severe acne with low incidence of serious side-effects.

#Evaluation of biophysical skin parameters and assessment of hair growth in patients with acne treated with isotretinoin 
by MaBgorzata L Kmie, Anna Pajor, Gra|yna Broniarczyk-DyBa

&gt;Patients were treated with isotretinoin at a dose of 0.5-1.0 mg/kg/day for a period of 4-7 months.

&gt;The results of biophysical skin parameter measurements after the treatment showed a reduction in the severity of seborrhea

&gt;The reduction in the skin sebum levels was observed after the treatment

&gt;Changes in the hair growth parameters showed telogen effluvium hair loss.

My takeaway : At standard dose, dry skin, erythema and changes in hair growth is observed. Hair's total count, density are less than before treatment.

#Effectiveness of conventional, low-dose and intermittent oral isotretinoin in the treatment of acne: a randomized, controlled comparative study 
by J W Lee, K H Yoo, K Y Park, T Y Han, K Li, S J Seo, C K Hong

&gt;In this study, 60 patients with moderate acne were enrolled and randomized to receive either isotretinoin at 0·5-0·7 mg kg{¹ daily (group A), isotretinoin at 0·25-0·4 mg kg{¹ daily (group B) or isotretinoin at 0·5-0·7 mg kg{¹ daily for 1 week out of every 4 weeks (group C).

&gt;The total period of drug administration was 6 weeks in group C, and 24 weeks in groups A and B

&gt;These results suggest that the conventional and low-dose regimens have similar efficacy.

&gt;Intermittent treatment had less effect than either conventional or low-dose treatments.

&gt;Side-effects were more frequent with conventional treatment compared with low-dose and intermittent treatments

&gt;One year after the end of treatment, two of 16 patients relapsed in group A, three of 17 patients relapsed in group B, and nine of 16 patients relapsed in group C. 

My takeaway : At lower dose therapy is better than the higher and intermittent dose because it had better patient's satisfaction. They didn't talk about side-effects.

#Making sense of the effects of the cumulative dose of isotretinoin in acne vulgaris 
by Marius Rademaker

&gt;This study aimed to determine the influence of daily and cumulative dosage on relapse in acne

&gt;Of 1453 patients, 326 (22.4%) received a second course of treatment (study population). The remainder served as controls (n = 1127)

&gt;Dosage varied from 10 mg/week to 1.1 mg/kg/d, cumulative dosage from 1 to &gt;300 mg/kg, and duration of treatment from 8 weeks to 5 years

&gt;Patients treated with very low doses (e.g. 10 mg three times per week) and/or low cumulative doses (e.g. 25-50 mg/kg) did not relapse more often than controls. 

&gt;Neither daily nor cumulative dosages influenced relapse of acne vulgaris in patients treated with varying doses of isotretinoin as long as treatment was continued for e2 months after the acne had completely resolved. 

My takeaway : To reduce risk of relapse, isotretinoin treatment after the acne is cleared out is needed.

i am taking Isotretinoin 20 mg/day. At the moment, I am on my day 23 on accutane and my therapy will be for 6 months. There is one fact, which i want to share with the community.

I am doing bodybuilding for 5 years and supplements are in commun use in this sport. My main focus is on omega 3 fatty acids because I take 1g omega-3 every day in capsule form. During therapy, I noticed that my lips, mucous membranes and eyes dry out less. After a short research, I found out that this effect is favored by the omega-3. In addition, I have linked the scientific study.

2024-06-11,1718144083,Don't make my Accutane mistake,"This might be a good post for you if you've taken accutane for months and haven't seen results yet, because I've been there.  
I'm on my third course of isotretinoin and have been thinking about some wisdom to share that I wish was told to me the first time I took it.

For medical context, the typical cumulative dose goal is 120-150mg/kg. My first course I completed 370mg/kg, my second course I completed 170mg/kg. (*I completed these over 7 years ago*) I'm currently finishing my 9th month, currently at 80mg, for a cumulative at the end of this month of 285mg/kg. Unfortunately I'm a pro at this; currently doing this round to get into a good remission for my upcoming wedding.

First round of Accutane 9 years ago was very rough for me. I had immensely painful purging and continued to have severe acne at 6 months in at a high dose for my weight (80mg). After several more months I was clear enough to stop the medication and see what happened, but was out of remission within 4 months. So several months later they put me on Absorica for my second round. This worked very well! (It is also very very expensive) Unfortunately, I'm the type of person who doesn't stay in remission from acne long, so a year later I had acne again, but that's honestly beside the point. What's important for this post is: What's the difference between Accutane (Isotretinoin) and Absorica and why did one work and not the other?

[From this journal review:](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10464604/)  
""Isotretinoin is poor water solubility that limits oral bioavailability and requires a **high-fat (50gram fat) and high-calorie (8001000 calories) meal for better absorption.** The bioavailability of isotretinoin increased 1.5 to 2 times more significantly when the dose was administered 1 hour before, concomitantly with, or 1 hour after a meal than when it was taken during a complete fast. This recommendation cannot be followed in many patients, which may result in poor treatment efficacy.""

Absorica is formulated differently and does not have this requirement and has equal absorption while fasting v with eating a high fat meal.

Does this mean EVERYONE needs to have 50 grams of fat with their pill when they take Accutane? *Absolutely not*.

Is this a possible reason why you haven't had the results you want yet? *It was for me.*

I started this course of it with the exact same severity (maybe more severe?) as when I started it 9 years ago. Since this third course on standard isotretinoin, I've had a 50 gram fat meal with it every time. I had \~1 month of purge and then it's only improved rapidly from there.

50 grams fat is a really hard goal to reach while being healthy and it is NOT easy. If any of you want meal planning recipes let me know and I'm happy to send! Hope this is helpful to someone out there.

**TL;DR:** Have a source of high fat and a big meal with your doses. It made a huge difference for me.

2022-11-09,1667972006,Permanent Dry Eye After Accutane - A Warning,"Recently I've seen quite a few posts regarding dry eye and accutane. As somebody who took 2 full courses of accutane and developed severe dry eye, I thought I'd make a post to share my experience and what I've learned. I'm not a doctor or a research scientist so take this with a grain of salt.

Many studies have shown that accutane can cause dry eye during and after treatment. The reason this happens is because accutane targets secretory glands and overloads them with vitamin A which basically kills the oil-producing cells and atrophies the gland. This is how accutane treats acne, it makes your skin permanently produce less oil. Our eyes have very similar secretory glands called meibomian glands that secret oils which prevent tears from evaporating. Accutane is a systemic drug, and so it also atrophies these meibomian glands. Once enough of those cells die and glands shrink to a certain threshold, it triggers symptomatic dry eye or meibomian gland dysfunction. A lot of times the damage accutane causes during treatment does not cross this threshold so patients don't experience symptoms, but meibomian glands atrophy as we age, so you see cases of people getting dry eye years after accutane.

As for how dry eye can affect you, it depends on your severity. It can range from barely noticeable to constant life-altering pain. Personally, I have severe dry eye and am no longer able to play video games, watch TV, or even go outside due to the pain caused by wind and air conditioning. I know many people in support groups who have had to leave their careers, studies, and previous lifestyle due to this disease. For more anecdotes on how dry eye affects people's lives check out r/dryeyes.

Treatments for dry eye do exist, but the damage to the meibomian glands is irreversible with modern medicine and thus there is no cure. Effectiveness of treatments depends on severity but generally do not remove the pain, only reduce it to an extent. Dry eye is also not recognized by insurance worldwide and modern treatments cost thousands of dollars annually, all out of pocket.

This post isn't intended to be medical advice and it's not all doom and gloom. Most accutane patients do not develop permanent dry eye from what I've seen. Whether you want to take the risk is up to you and your doctor, but you should know that this seemingly harmless but potentially life-altering disease is a possibility.

The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important cellular host protein required for virus entry. The expression of this protein occurs in many tissues, including the lung, oral mucosa, intestine, heart, kidney, endothelium and skin.

""For their current study, the researchers from the Egyptian Tanta University have used results from previous research projects with isotretinoin. With the retinoid, the scientists suspect a possible mechanism of action against sars-CoV-2 through the inhibitory effect of the ACE2 receptor. The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important cellular host protein required for virus entry. The expression of this protein occurs in many tissues, including the lung, oral mucosa, intestine, heart, kidney, endothelium and skin. Cells expressing ACE2 are susceptible to sars-CoV-2 infection because the ACE2 receptor facilitates virus entry and replication."" [...] (translated with deepL)

Hi everyone :)

About me: I have had persistent moderate acne since age 11 and sebaceous hyperplasia since my early twenties (now 37 years old). The effectiveness of isotretinoin for acne treatment is pretty widely known, so I mainly wanted to make this post for anyone struggling with sebaceous hyperplasia-- in addition to acne or otherwise!

Typical treatments for sebaceous hyperplasia include chemical peels, laser therapy, and electrocautery. None of these are permanent, however, and people who are predisposed to lesions will tend to see more new spots pop up over time.

The only information I had ever been able to find on clinically proven methods to permanently treat sebaceous hyperplasia was this article from 2015, in which patients received a 1mg/kg/day dose of isotretinoin for two months and were then monitored for two years afterward (spoiler alert: it was very successful!): [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4371670/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4371670/)

With my 38th birthday around the corner, I suppose I finally realized that I might not ""grow out of"" my acne after all. The possibility of still battling acne at 40 seemed so disheartening to me, so I decided to try isotretinoin as a last resort. (Side note: this was a big deal and a huge decision, as I have never been on any kind of prescription medication before in my life, ever, for anything at all.) While acne was my primary concern, I was still curious to see if the treatment would do anything to my sebaceous hyperplasia as an added bonus. Well, here I am at three weeks and the photos say it all!

I just made this side-by-side comparison today and I almost couldn't believe it. The lesions on my forehead were the ones that bothered me the most, and they have all but vanished. The others on my temples and cheeks are disappearing as well (harder to show in photos though since they were always mixed in with the acne spots, but I threw in a side profile before-and-after just for reference).

In conclusion, as the title says, isotretinoin is succesfully clearing both my sebaceous hyperplasia and the acne I have been struggling with since 1996. My only regret is not starting sooner. Looking at these progress photos almost makes me cry!

2021-01-04,1609788571,Accutane (isotretinoin) and pregnancy - happy ending! AMA,"Hi there! Im posting because I know how desperately I was looking for answers and any guidance when I got pregnant right after finishing my course and I want to help people in the same situation. If I help only one person, then its already worth it. I started taking a generic version of Accutane/Roaccutane in August, 10 mg/day for a month, then 20 mg until January 15, then 40 mg between January 15 - February 15. Finished the course on February 15, conceived my baby around February 25. Found out I was pregnant on March 8. I had implantation bleeding on March 7-8-9, so roughly 21 days after I finished the course. The manufacturer says that women can absolutely not get pregnant for another month after finishing the course, because the isotretinoin is still in their system and can affect the baby and cause birth defects as much as if they were still taking it. I spent SO many nights googling and googling and googling... looking for anything that could prove it otherwise. Went through all the recent research studies on both humans and animals, data collected on the outcome of accutane pregnancies etc. everything I could find. Based on my own research, I concluded that with the half-time accutane has, it leaves a healthy, young, not overweight persons system in about 5 days max. Which means that by the time I got pregnant it had been out of my system for 5 days. And as the embryo is basically unaffected by anything in the mothers body until it implants in the mothers uterus, in my case it had been ~21 days since I stopped taking the medication until my baby implanted and couldve been affected by it for the first time. I had a doctor in my home country (in Europe) tell me that as much as he is pro-life, I can absolutely not keep this baby because in his opinion (he was in his 60s, speaks no English - hence, has no access to the studies of the leading medical research institutes in the English speaking world and probably everything he knows about it he learned about 30 years ago, so he was definitely not up to date on modern research studies in the topic) it takes 6 months for isotretinoin to get out of my system as it is stored in my fat cells (NOT true!) Although isotretinoin is a Vitamin A derivative, it doesnt have the same qualities - Vitamin A is stored in fat cells for a long time, but isotretinoin is not. The manufacturer probably recommends to wait 30 days to get pregnant because in some very rare cases (obesity, extremely low rate of metabolism, old age etc.) it takes that long for it to leave a womans system. But the average time is 5 days for a healthy, young person. Anyway, this doctor tells me to abort the baby ASAP, because there is no way the he/she will be healthy. He booked me for an abortion a week later. I cried and cried and kept googling - finally decided to keep the baby on the day of the abortion. I decided that as much as the anxiety and the uncertainty around the health of my unborn baby for the rest of the pregnancy sucked - it wouldve sucked even more to abort him/her without knowing for sure that he/she has a birth defect as a result of me taking accutane. I took it one step at a time - the 12 week ultrasound, then the 20 week anatomy scan... My baby passed all of them with flying colors, growing beautifully with a strong heartbeat and zero complications during pregnancy. Born full term, easy, fast and uncomplicated birth, weighed over 8 lbs, healthy as can be, passing all the tests at the hospital, which we left less than 48 hours after babe was born. LO is still super healthy and strong, hitting all their milestones, eating like a champ. All in all, I couldnt be happier that I didnt listen to that doctor and kept my baby. I know that my situation is a bit different from others, as I already stopped taking accutane by the time I conceived my baby, but according to the manufacturers instructions, I was definitely still not in the clear... I know that every body is different, Im a young, healthy and slim woman in her mid-late twenties, so maybe for me it takes less time to wash accutane out of my system than for someone who is lets say is 40 and overweight.
