Accutane,1hqykqa,"New Additions to Low Efforts; ""SHOULD I GO ON ACCUTANE?""",Please remember this is Reddit and we are strangers. Posts asking if one should start Accutane without a picture of the user's skin and/or a brief summary of one's acne struggles will be removed. No one here is qualified to assess you for Accutane and you should first see a doctor or dermatologist to assess your condition.,Thankkkk yooouuu. So annoying!! Only a derm will be able to tell you if it is a good option.
Accutane,1hqykqk,Do not solicit medical advice,"First and foremost a happy new year to everyone. With the new year we will be much stricter on the do not solicit medical advice rule. We know many people going ""Just looking for experiences (:"" are looking to circumvent doctor's advice. It is a thinly veiled attempt at ""if he or she did it I can too."" Everyone is different and has a different medical history so you should always first and foremost consult your doctor or derm. Things that generally constitute medical advice include: \ Anything that could break your skin including extractions lasers waxing etc. \ Any use of PRESCRIPTION medications(oral or topical) \ Surgery related(HELLO YOU REALLY WANT A STRANGER TO ADVISE YOU ON SURGERY?) \ Starting and/or stopping a MEDICATION. Your accutane is prescribed by a doctor. If you have conerns about taking or ceasing a medication you should consult a medical professional(ie doctor or pharmacist) and not the internet. \ IS THIS DOSE TOO HIGH OR LOW? \ Interpreting of lab/test results. This is clearly specialized knowledge and if you would not consult a hobo about your lab results you most clearly should not consult Reddit. \ Oh my doctor said not to worry but... Reddit in most situations should not supercede your doctor's medical advice. Ultimately it will always be at the mod's discretion and we were not born yesterday. You would surprised at how many crazy posts have had to be removed.",No comments
Accutane,1ivtv2c,First time going out without makeup in about 12 years,I'm 24 now and since I was 12 I wore makeup every single day to cover my acne. 4 months on accutne and I've seen good progress so I'm going to try and stop wearing makeup. Definitely still have redness scars discoloration that the camera doesn't really pick but I'm starting to actually like my face again!,You look amazing!
