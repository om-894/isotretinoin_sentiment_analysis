acne,1iw1me9,Advice on dealing with acne ? I feel like I’ve tried everything but nothing works for me,The last photo is most recent and second is about 3 months ago so I’ve definitely seen improvement with skin texture from using over the counter retinol but my acne itself remains. I’m not really sure why diet wise I’ve been eating low sugar/rarely eat out and get greasy foods. I track my water intake/etc My skincare routine mostly looks like this: AM: gentle gel face cleanser or salicylic acid cleanser (depending on how sensitive my skin is feeling) niacinamide serum cream moisturizer (since I have sensitive skin that tends to get dry around this time of year) spf PM: oil cleanser niacinamide serum 1% retinol (used every other day to prevent sensitivity) snail mucin moisturizer cream moisturizer,Totally unrelated but you’re so pretty

I want to add that you are beautiful. I have no idea what to do. Have you tried warm packs before bed and first thing in the morning. I don't know just trying to help with the redness.

It’s 95% of the time hormonal. If your issue is hormonal as well here are things that have worked for me. 1. Birth Control. Takes about 3 months to really kick in. 2. Curology. 3. Spironolactone. This is a good option if you don’t want to take birth control. 4. Differin. I’m 41/F. I had it as a teen and then it came back in my 30’s. I am currently on birth control and I use Differin. Totally free of acne at this point. Hope this helps!

Accutane is too aggressive your skin isnt bad enough and i dont think a derm would suggest it. 2. Birth control worked for me but then my body adjusted and i probably had clear skin for a year. What I did notice is one if your cheeks looks a little more affected than the other. This happened to me when my pillows werent clean all the time. I suggest washing it every 3 days to a week and your sheets weekly. Try panoxyl face/body wash or antibacterial soap unscented. If you like swimming i also recommend that just make sure to moisturize. If not a chemical peel should do wonders as well im getting my first one in a month.

I guarantee you success it worked for me and I had the worst acne in the world. Good luck and let me know how that works out for you.

I haven’t tried warm packs before but that’s a good idea my pimples are usually red like this when they’re new but it helps when I stick a pimple patch over it. My biggest issue are the dark spots that come after the pimples healed and the once my dark spots are almost healed I get even more pimples 😓

Though sometimes you will get mood swings and will get irritated very frequently and I remember I became very emotional and used to cry at every little thing I also got slight IBS during accutane and it was totally my mistake I ate maggie (white flour noodles) without any veggie and drank less water that day. So the next morning on the toilet I had trouble pushing the poop out and hence got a fissure. Once my accutane stopped my intestine went back to normal so folks if you’re on ANY medication make sure to eat a lot of veggies and drink atleast 2.5 L of water/day. PS: my skin looks better than ever everyone compliments me now no new acne I’ve never been this happy. I only apply moisturizer to my face every night and use cleanser before sleeping. The wait was worth it the purging was worth it. Also while on accutane stay away from the mirror for a few months you’ll feel better about yourself. :)

acne,1iwa1au,Pimples every night,Every day when I wake up I have pimples in my cheeks and forehead I’m doing a routine skin care with Effaclar and a balanced diet can somebody help me.,Maybe you are allergic on something that may trigger your pimples. You can apply some cream to reduce and clear it I may not fond of skin care but found some good results of using skinfix especially my friend of mine. Maybe you can try it
