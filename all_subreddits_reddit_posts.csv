AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands. It does not selectively target sebum/oil glands of the skin however; it also reduces glands in other body structures: synovial membranes meibomian glands mucocutaneous glands etc). * Accutane kills stem cells. Stem cells are necessary for lifelong repair of tissues. * Accutane changes genetic expression of at least 500 (likely more) genes..this has been shown in studies. * Accutane causes oxidative damage to the DNA and tissues of the body * A study showed that at least 7% (this is in clinical trials with close monitoring; these days often doctors encourage patients to continue their treatment despite displaying side effects that could become permanent) have permanent physiological changes post accutane. * Accutane has been shown in histological studies to change tissues including skin tendons nerves cartilage bone and brain. * Accutane changes the expression of critical connective tissue proteins in the body: downregulates hyaluronic acid (the water holding molecule that keeps your joints skin and other connective tissues healthy and plump) downregulates collagen (in skin and connective tissue the 'matrix' protein of the body) and downregulates elastin (the protein that keeps your connective tissues pliable and elastic). * Thousands upon thousands of people have described eerily similar serious health issues occurring post accutane some with occuring rapidly and some slowly over time. These people all describe having no risks of these conditions in their family and being perfectly healthy before developing these health issues. * There are many other toxic substance exposures that have now been proven over decades of research to have delayed onset health issues (increased risk of health issues down the line): cigarettes mercury lead etc. * Studies exist to show increased risks of chronic health issues in nations that have higher vitamin A intake and taking accutane is basically like a nuclear bomb of a vitamin A derivative. * We know that Accutane can permanently stunt growth by closing epiphyseal plates * Accutane can damage structures and organs that create and regulate our hormones which can cause long lasting and delayed onset health impacts (damage to testes/ovaries > long lasting damage to the production of sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen > long lasting/permanent damage to tissues and organs) Above are the existing body of research and understanding that lead us to believe that Accutane definitely can cause permanent health damage and mechanistically we can understand why this may occur with a delayed effect (stem cell damage DNA damage changes in protein expression for critical connective tissue proteins). Lastly here are 262 pages of (open source) scientific abstracts to studies showing isotretinoin as being incredibly toxic.

My mother and I were participants in a study sponsored by La Roche of the effects of isotretenoin in utero in 1991. I have spent my whole life with unexplained medical issues and doctors that don’t want to listen or doctors who don’t know anything about the drug or it’s effects. At 30 years old I feel as though I live in the body of an 80 year old (and not the spry kind of 80). I am searching for any other people who may have been part of this trial or one like it. These studies led to the conclusion that accutane causes major birth defects.

I had tried all other medications and creams available but after 4 years of no luck and a lot of pain it was my only option. It worked; I have not had to worry a single day about acne ever again and am now 30 years old acne and scarring free. I did however randomly stop growing altogether at 13/14 years old and am still the same height I was then 5ft 2. I was always one of the shortest kids at school so was never expected to be more than about 5ft 7 as the doctors predicted. But 5ft 2 is incredibly short for a guy especially considering my father is 6ft 1. His whole family are all around/just either side of average. My mother is 5ft 3 so around average height but her whole family are around average also with the men usually ending up around 5ft 9. My younger brothers have both ended up at 5ft 6 and 5ft 9 but continued growing noticeably until they were around 20. Looking at my wider family I would've expected me to end up between 5ft 5 and 5ft 8 but I never quite got there like everyone else. I don't want to put it down to roaccutane as it worked wonders for my skin and mental health at the time but it seems the only plausible explanation that I would just randomly stop growing around the same time I had the course and stay the same height as I was at 13 years old forever. 🤔

But i feel like the risks are highly exaggerated due to misinterpretation of the data. saying "" Accutane causes oxidative damage to the DNA and tissues of the body "" sounds scary but most drugs damage dna and cells to a certain extent even some commonly used food products. I've heard that accutane causes joint pain in most cases it just speeds up an underlying condition which had been developing prior to accutane use. Now I have finished my accutane course 3 months ago and so far I couldn't be happier with the results. In my case I've been diagnosed with depression and had severe social anxiety due to acne. It was ""crippling"" to a certain level. In my case I'd rather choose to have the physical side effects describe above than to be mentally ""crippled"" and unable to live my life to the fullest. If not for accutane I would have been either hanging from a ceilling or locked up in a mental institution. My life has turned 180 degrees around. But this is my experience and what I had gathered from it. All people have different experiences and this was mine."

I took accutane nearly 13 years ago at 16. I was 5’11”at 15 years old (predicted to be 6’3” like my dad and all the males from my generation) and I started accutane at 16… I’ve not grown an inch since starting. For the longest time I blamed it on sleep deprivation (too many AP classes and extra curricular). Now I’m 29 and in decent health (testosterone is lower but within the standard range for my age group) but suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome (no joint pain fortunately). I blamed this on a bad case of mono in my Freshman year of college… I’ve tried improving my diet and regularly scheduled exercise but it “barely” helps me tolerate my day to day responsibilities as an engineer and father… if anyone has suggestions on boosting natural energy let me know.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later.

The superficial stuff tho that affected looks kills me.. I mean keeps me up at night.. I'm now 30 and took it when I was 17 and never got 1 cm wider than I was then. Everyone in my family has very broad shoulders and was super skinny/narrow in high school.. My hair thinned. I now have mild ulcerative colitis.. The fact that I'll NEVER be able to know how much better looking and how much better my life could've been if I never took it.. Broader shoulders so I don't still look like a boy at 30.. Thick hair.

I took it for years. Ever since then I have been suffering from joint/muscle pain constant fatigue and exhaustion that has become unbearable. My joints feel like they are rubbing against each other and I have zero strength. I need heat for my joints and they feel stiff. Every step I take is painful and it's affecting my daily life in a significant way. Despite seeing multiple rheumatologists and doctors none of them have been able to find a solution or identify the root cause of my symptoms. I'd love to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience or has any advice on how to manage the symptoms. Thanks for listening.
AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands.

I remember playing basketball in 8th grade at the time. Half way through my knees were killing me my dumbass derm suggested to up the dose and keep going. I later went on to play college football and tore 12 ligaments. I don’t think there’s a limb that’s attached to my body. Truly it’s hell. My eyes fucking ruined. Everything ruined. I honestly don’t even like to think of all the stuff this drug did to me. Just don’t take it. Idc how bad ur acne is. Don’t take it. I just wanna kill myself everyday cause of the pain and hell I live in. But you look fine so people don’t care. Ill write a bigger post about it if I don’t fucking put a 9mil threw my head before. The pain please make it go away. It’s so discomfortable in this body. Please.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later.

When I was 15 a dermatologist gave me a dose of isotretinoin (accutane) of 40mg per day if I'm correct. Thankfully I was an irresponsible teenager and dropped out after not very long on the course. I'm 17 now and a few months ago I did a 1 month course on 20mg per day and after around a 30 day break post that course I've been on the same 20mg per day dosage for the past 3 weeks. I have read about your guys' experience with the horrible side effects and the chapped lips are already killing me. I wanted to ask about whether I will have a chance after stopping this dosage I don't want to experience these side effects and forsake my social and physical life.

To this day my skin has remained remarkably clear and I have maybe a zit or two a year. I thought it was a miracle drug at the time. Now I’m 34 years old finishing treatment 20 years ago. I have cirrhosis of the liver and am severely anemic. I struggle waking up and tend to sleep for 12 16 hours at a time and I take at least one 1 2 hour nap a day. I have been diagnosed with Bipolar I Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My ADHD is so unmanageable and that I have lost jobs time and time again. On top of that I have an awful OCD and have developed unshakeable ticks over the years and obsessive thoughts that have only worsened by already deteriorated mental state. I have had ED since I was 19 probably the worst time to have such an embarrassing disorder. No libido and things have just worsened as I’ve gotten older. Viagra just barely works but it also makes me nearly hallucinate so I don’t exactly love taking it. I can attribute every chronic (and in some cases potentially terminal) illness to Accutane. Admittedly I didn’t do myself any favors regarding my cirrhosis as I ruined my 20s by drinking 1L a vodka a day for probably 8 years. I did t know I had a compromised liver at the time but it was the only thing that could make me feel normal. I’ve been sober for 4 years now which is…whatever. It isn’t as “enlightening” as everyone claims it to be seeing as sobriety is “in” now. Nothing wrong with that but that’s another conversation. I no longer need a liver transplant but I still have a much higher likelihood of getting liver cancer by the time I’m 50 or 60. All that to say I think I may be happy for the first time in my life but it’s been a fuck ton of work and maintenance to get to this point. Anyway fuck Accutane or whatever the fuck they’re calling it these days. I apologize for the extended comment here; this is the first time I’ve shared all of this and it’s helped.

For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands. It does not selectively target sebum/oil glands of the skin however; it also reduces glands in other body structures: synovial membranes meibomian glands mucocutaneous glands etc). * Accutane kills stem cells. Stem cells are necessary for lifelong repair of tissues. * Accutane changes genetic expression of at least 500 (likely more) genes..this has been shown in studies. * Accutane causes oxidative damage to the DNA and tissues of the body * A study showed that at least 7% (this is in clinical trials with close monitoring; these days often doctors encourage patients to continue their treatment despite displaying side effects that could become permanent) have permanent physiological changes post accutane. * Accutane has been shown in histological studies to change tissues including skin tendons nerves cartilage bone and brain. * Accutane changes the expression of critical connective tissue proteins in the body: downregulates hyaluronic acid (the water holding molecule that keeps your joints skin and other connective tissues healthy and plump) downregulates collagen (in skin and connective tissue the 'matrix' protein of the body) and downregulates elastin (the protein that keeps your connective tissues pliable and elastic). * Thousands upon thousands of people have described eerily similar serious health issues occurring post accutane some with occuring rapidly and some slowly over time. These people all describe having no risks of these conditions in their family and being perfectly healthy before developing these health issues. * There are many other toxic substance exposures that have now been proven over decades of research to have delayed onset health issues (increased risk of health issues down the line): cigarettes mercury lead etc. * Studies exist to show increased risks of chronic health issues in nations that have higher vitamin A intake and taking accutane is basically like a nuclear bomb of a vitamin A derivative. * We know that Accutane can permanently stunt growth by closing epiphyseal plates * Accutane can damage structures and organs that create and regulate our hormones which can cause long lasting and delayed onset health impacts (damage to testes/ovaries > long lasting damage to the production of sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen > long lasting/permanent damage to tissues and organs) Above are the existing body of research and understanding that lead us to believe that Accutane definitely can cause permanent health damage and mechanistically we can understand why this may occur with a delayed effect (stem cell damage DNA damage changes in protein expression for critical connective tissue proteins).

I also got a handful of back to back BV infections. Vulvar pain and discomfort became a constant even after these infections but every time I would go back to the OB I was shocked to find that I did not have an infection. Years later and I have learned to manage the discomfort better but still suffer from chronic vulvar pain. The chronic UTIs went away (or so I thought) but when I became pregnant and my urine was being tested all the time I learned that I pretty much always have a low grade UTI. Usually with mild or no symptoms. Sometimes the culture would come back negative even though the dipstick came back positive. Years of consulting different OBs and Urologists and I have no diagnosis and no effective treatment for any of these problems. Spent last night in the ER with a severe UTI. My white blood count was elevated to the point they gave me a CT scan thinking it was a kidney infection. The thought literally just occurred to me that all of this started shortly after I took accutane. I thought I might be able to gain some insight from this group that I have so far been unable to obtain from doctors. Has anyone have any complications like this?

So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands. It does not selectively target sebum/oil glands of the skin however; it also reduces glands in other body structures: synovial membranes meibomian glands mucocutaneous glands etc). * Accutane kills stem cells. Stem cells are necessary for lifelong repair of tissues. * Accutane changes genetic expression of at least 500 (likely more) genes..this has been shown in studies. * Accutane causes oxidative damage to the DNA and tissues of the body * A study showed that at least 7% (this is in clinical trials with close monitoring; these days often doctors encourage patients to continue their treatment despite displaying side effects that could become permanent) have permanent physiological changes post accutane. * Accutane has been shown in histological studies to change tissues including skin tendons nerves cartilage bone and brain. * Accutane changes the expression of critical connective tissue proteins in the body: downregulates hyaluronic acid (the water holding molecule that keeps your joints skin and other connective tissues healthy and plump) downregulates collagen (in skin and connective tissue the 'matrix' protein of the body) and downregulates elastin (the protein that keeps your connective tissues pliable and elastic). * Thousands upon thousands of people have described eerily similar serious health issues occurring post accutane some with occuring rapidly and some slowly over time. These people all describe having no risks of these conditions in their family and being perfectly healthy before developing these health issues. * There are many other toxic substance exposures that have now been proven over decades of research to have delayed onset health issues (increased risk of health issues down the line): cigarettes mercury lead etc. * Studies exist to show increased risks of chronic health issues in nations that have higher vitamin A intake and taking accutane is basically like a nuclear bomb of a vitamin A derivative. * We know that Accutane can permanently stunt growth by closing epiphyseal plates * Accutane can damage structures and organs that create and regulate our hormones which can cause long lasting and delayed onset health impacts (damage to testes/ovaries > long lasting damage to the production of sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen > long lasting/permanent damage to tissues and organs) Above are the existing body of research and understanding that lead us to believe that Accutane definitely can cause permanent health damage and mechanistically we can understand why this may occur with a delayed effect (stem cell damage DNA damage changes in protein expression for critical connective tissue proteins). Lastly here are 262 pages of (open source) scientific abstracts to studies showing isotretinoin as being incredibly toxic.

My experience hasn’t physically been as extreme as a lot of the reports on here thankfully. And my acne did clear up quite quickly. However I did notice a severe mood change when I started the medication which developed into further mental health problems down the road. I am assuming this is down to Roaccutane (UK) as there is no other logical trigger for it and it was a sudden change. I’m mostly fine I guess. It’s just a battle. And if I were to have a word with my 14 year old self I’d recommend just living with the acne and sacking off the drug treatment.

For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands. It does not selectively target sebum/oil glands of the skin however; it also reduces glands in other body structures: synovial membranes meibomian glands mucocutaneous glands etc). * Accutane kills stem cells. Stem cells are necessary for lifelong repair of tissues. * Accutane changes genetic expression of at least 500 (likely more) genes..this has been shown in studies. * Accutane causes oxidative damage to the DNA and tissues of the body * A study showed that at least 7% (this is in clinical trials with close monitoring; these days often doctors encourage patients to continue their treatment despite displaying side effects that could become permanent) have permanent physiological changes post accutane. * Accutane has been shown in histological studies to change tissues including skin tendons nerves cartilage bone and brain. * Accutane changes the expression of critical connective tissue proteins in the body: downregulates hyaluronic acid (the water holding molecule that keeps your joints skin and other connective tissues healthy and plump) downregulates collagen (in skin and connective tissue the 'matrix' protein of the body) and downregulates elastin (the protein that keeps your connective tissues pliable and elastic). * Thousands upon thousands of people have described eerily similar serious health issues occurring post accutane some with occuring rapidly and some slowly over time. These people all describe having no risks of these conditions in their family and being perfectly healthy before developing these health issues. * There are many other toxic substance exposures that have now been proven over decades of research to have delayed onset health issues (increased risk of health issues down the line): cigarettes mercury lead etc. * Studies exist to show increased risks of chronic health issues in nations that have higher vitamin A intake and taking accutane is basically like a nuclear bomb of a vitamin A derivative. * We know that Accutane can permanently stunt growth by closing epiphyseal plates * Accutane can damage structures and organs that create and regulate our hormones which can cause long lasting and delayed onset health impacts (damage to testes/ovaries > long lasting damage to the production of sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen > long lasting/permanent damage to tissues and organs) Above are the existing body of research and understanding that lead us to believe that Accutane definitely can cause permanent health damage and mechanistically we can understand why this may occur with a delayed effect (stem cell damage DNA damage changes in protein expression for critical connective tissue proteins). Lastly here are 262 pages of (open source) scientific abstracts to studies showing isotretinoin as being incredibly toxic.

It does cause profound oxidative damage to the DNA and is a chemotherapeutic drug. You may not even be able to fully comprehend the extent of the damage this has the capacity to cause. I myself know many people who have been ok during the drug a few months after the drug but years later develop issues related to post retinoid syndrome that do not run in their family at all. Don’t get too high and mighty yet my friend. You don’t know yet what kind of damage this could cause for you later on. You just don’t.

Also what is really important for doctors to prescribe this drug in lower doses over a longer period of time. This wil prevent some side effects i think

It does not selectively target sebum/oil glands of the skin however; it also reduces glands in other body structures: synovial membranes meibomian glands mucocutaneous glands etc). * Accutane kills stem cells. Stem cells are necessary for lifelong repair of tissues. * Accutane changes genetic expression of at least 500 (likely more) genes..this has been shown in studies. * Accutane causes oxidative damage to the DNA and tissues of the body * A study showed that at least 7% (this is in clinical trials with close monitoring; these days often doctors encourage patients to continue their treatment despite displaying side effects that could become permanent) have permanent physiological changes post accutane. * Accutane has been shown in histological studies to change tissues including skin tendons nerves cartilage bone and brain. * Accutane changes the expression of critical connective tissue proteins in the body: downregulates hyaluronic acid (the water holding molecule that keeps your joints skin and other connective tissues healthy and plump) downregulates collagen (in skin and connective tissue the 'matrix' protein of the body) and downregulates elastin (the protein that keeps your connective tissues pliable and elastic). * Thousands upon thousands of people have described eerily similar serious health issues occurring post accutane some with occuring rapidly and some slowly over time.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane?

I know people who took it as a teen and who did grow and those whose growth plates were verifiably closed (open before the drug suddenly closed at a premature age of 14 15 16 etc). It really depends. How bad do your joints feel these days? Stiff painful sore achy? Do you feel like an older person? This can all be from accutane. So sorry you are hurt.
AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands.

Aside from changes that come with aging (peri/menopause) this can be caused by meds that affects hormones. This is more commonly caused by birth control however the acne med spironolactone is a known cause as well. I’m assuming accutane can affect the vulvar tissue similarly due to its effects on testosterone as well. You may benefit from seeking out a vulva or vulvodynia specialist. A prescribed estrogen/testosterone cream applied to the vulva may help improve your symptoms. The vulvovaginal tissues and urethra/bladder are filled with estrogen and testosterone receptors. When the tissues are deprived of one or both hormones it can cause thinning inflammation and pain. This also puts you at increased for vaginal infections and uti or uti like symptoms.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands.

This side effect did (thankfully) go away after a while. But yes I have always enjoyed sex which is why it was so impactful on my life when I noticed the huge changes in my body’s sexual response or lack of that coincided with my Accutane use.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands. It does not selectively target sebum/oil glands of the skin however; it also reduces glands in other body structures: synovial membranes meibomian glands mucocutaneous glands etc). * Accutane kills stem cells.

It screws up your immune system (frequent infections) and damages muscles/connective tissues leading to chronic pain. There is only one thing that will help : stop all drugs do not ingest any kind of poison even OTC garbage like advil. Commit to a 100% raw diet of mostly fruit. Won't take more than a couple of months for you to feel better. Try it and watch what happens.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands. It does not selectively target sebum/oil glands of the skin however; it also reduces glands in other body structures: synovial membranes meibomian glands mucocutaneous glands etc). * Accutane kills stem cells.

They are living evidence. Only pharmaceutical companies require evidence but do everything they can to reject it because they are liable. This is not a science experiment. It is real people being hurt by real poison. There is no safe dose of poison. And chemo drugs rank as among the most toxic ever made. There is no way to create health with poison. Poison only damages health. In any amount. The way to create health in the body is by expelling toxins not by ingesting them. Unfortunately doctors don't tell you that. Instead they send you away with an rx.

My doctor said that Accutane have just the normal side effects but she didn't warned me about long term even permanent side effects.
AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands.

Thing is I do have the rights to know the associated risks and side effects. My derm told me I'd only have dry eyes for a few days. Guess what? I had chronic headaches and acid reflux problems. I can be sure it's caused by Accutane because I've never had headaches or any stomach problems in my entire life before. Not even once and I'm not exaggerating. Now I'm with a weakened immune system. Before Accutane the worst I used to get was a flu every 2 years but after this I feel like I'm an old man

I've been off this dog shit drug for 6 years on 80mg and my body is that fatigue it ain't funny. I can't even fucking dry my hair without stopping a few times my joints feel like they are being dipped in lava and i physically just can't continue doing things for extent times I can't put much pressure on my joints or i get worn out way to easy. Even stretching my body.. I nearly have to get in and take breaks from trying to do nice and easy stretches.. Shits a fucking joke honestly. I had fucked blood circulation Insane head spins every time i get up I've had fits related to this and nearly smashed my head on the ground. Everything honestly. Fuck this drug Just an example Joints are destroyed.. Oh also don't move to quick i'll pull 18 fucking muscles in the process I've heard someone else recommend nad plus what else do you recommend?

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later.

Ya I’ve been off for 6 years now too and I’m still dealing with it. Nad plus helps a ton but red light therapy is my favorite. They have it at tanning salons. But ya blood circulation is one of the worst side effects from it. Red light therapy helps your blood circulation a ton. Look it up.

AccutaneDamage,fwmkhc,"Response to: ""Did Accutane cause my ____ health issues that occured months/years later on in life?""",This is a frequent question that anyone who develops health issues later on in life months or years after stopping the drug. Please read this response because there's a lot of evidence that points to a probable 'yes' without being able to 'prove' it without a shadow of a doubt per say. **Here's the best way to explain it:** Has there been clear definitive research PROVING all of the long term effects of chronic retinoic acid toxicity decades down the line? Sadly no not yet. Accutane has been around since the '80's and young peoples' lives and health have been destroyed since then. Sadly since many of the effects have delayed onset post exposure toxicity when patients develop health effects months or years down the line their injuries and damage is often unreported and go unnoticed for decades. This and the massive conflicts of interests that exist to produce massive bodies of research to display this drug in a safe and favorable light prevents proper long term safety research from being conducted. So we have a situation where unfortunately our hands are 'tied' with post exposure health problems. With the currently existing literature it is hard to prove this in large population wide studies (which don't exist) but logically and mechanistically we can find a few things. For example we CAN use a few factors to determine the likelihood that your health issues were caused by accutane: * Do any of your siblings parents or grandparents have the specific health issues you have (and more importantly did they develop it at such a young age)? If so then perhaps it is genetic or a combination of things if not this is suspect that you maybe have developed an environmentally induced health issue. Ask yourself what is different between you/your family: you took accutane. * Did you have pre existing health issues/autoimmune issues / other problems prior to taking accutane? If so then it's a bit trickier to know if these issues just developed or were caused by accutane. If not it's more suspect. * Look at the types of health issues you have: what you describe with your health issues is very common in the post accutane community. Often these health issues occur further on down the line many years later. **On another note we can look at it this way:** * Accutane is a type of chemotherapy (causes bodywide cell death of all cells in the body lookup Bodo Melnik Fox0) * It has been SHOWN that chemo survivors have much more significant health issues (degenerative chronic) that occur further down the line years later. This has actually been researched. * Accutane causes PERMANENT changes to the structure of the skin reducing/atrophying oil glands. It does not selectively target sebum/oil glands of the skin however; it also reduces glands in other body structures: synovial membranes meibomian glands mucocutaneous glands etc). * Accutane kills stem cells. Stem cells are necessary for lifelong repair of tissues. * Accutane changes genetic expression of at least 500 (likely more) genes..this has been shown in studies. * Accutane causes oxidative damage to the DNA and tissues of the body * A study showed that at least 7% (this is in clinical trials with close monitoring; these days often doctors encourage patients to continue their treatment despite displaying side effects that could become permanent) have permanent physiological changes post accutane. * Accutane has been shown in histological studies to change tissues including skin tendons nerves cartilage bone and brain. * Accutane changes the expression of critical connective tissue proteins in the body: downregulates hyaluronic acid (the water holding molecule that keeps your joints skin and other connective tissues healthy and plump) downregulates collagen (in skin and connective tissue the 'matrix' protein of the body) and downregulates elastin (the protein that keeps your connective tissues pliable and elastic). * Thousands upon thousands of people have described eerily similar serious health issues occurring post accutane some with occuring rapidly and some slowly over time.

Which organ systems?* \*\*Musculoskeletal system neuromuscular system skin eyes hair neurological.\*\*SEVERE crippling joint bone nerve muscle and tendon pain throughout entire body all joints crack and pop (feel dried out) can barely move or walk sometimes due to severity of pain continues to get worse over time. Eyes became painfully dry (did not have this on treatment) developed floaters tinnitus and hair loss (50% of hair). Brain fog severe chronic fatigue thin permanently dry and damaged skin. *2. How long ago did you take it? At what dose (if you can remember) and duration (how long you took it)?* I finished taking it over a year ago. I took 20mg for 5 months. *3. What were your side effects while you took the drug?* Mild moderate pain and stiffness in an ankle where I had a previous injury and previous pain after twisting it exercising. I did not consider it to be serious. Skin dryness hair dryness and minor hair shedding towards the end. Nothing ""serious"". Bloodwork was normal. *4. What are your injuries/damage after you stopped taking the drug?* Everything described above happened months after I stopped taking the drug. *5. Did additional harmful effects occur after yous stopped taking it?* Y*es.* *6. How has damage from this drug impacted your daily life (work hobbies abilities)?* The damage has been so crippling that despite being in my 20's I feel like I'm 90 and had to quit my job. I'm in physical hell constantly. I am scared that the rest of my life will be like this. I can barely walk some days or do minor chores like self care dishes laundry etc. The pain is serious and I feel as if my body is being burned alive by acid all my joints crack always. *7. Do you feel you were given proper informed consent about the long term risks and damage of this drug?* No not at all. I took a ""low"" dose and my doctor misled me about the risks associated with it. He said serious effects only happened at much higher doses and even so rarely (1/100 000 or so) which I now know is not true. I was never warned about delayed onset post retinoid toxicity / damage where the damage could occur without warning months after I quit the drug. I was given inaccurate industry funded cherry picked research concluding that there is no link between accutane and IBS (now I know this is bullshit) or accutane and depression (also fraudulent). *8. Since you stopped taking accutane have your health issues stayed the same (as when you were on the drug) improved or gotten worse?* All of my symptoms have progressively and continuously gotten worse over the months since I stopped taking it. 9. I have tried various diets and natural methods to manage my symptoms but nothing ever gets rid of the pain ever or helps it. Nothing seems to be able to touch the pain no matter what I try despite eating a very clean and healthy diet."

Severe back pain I feel like I am 80 years old even though I'm in my 20's still. It's honestly horrific and unless you have it you don't understand how horrible chronic spine issues are. 2. 2017 3 years ago. I took around 30 40mg as I remember not a ridiculously high dose. I only took it for 4 months so I only reached a fraction of my 'cumulative dose. 3. Mostly my back is in agonizing pain and I can see that my discs are dried out in my MRI. I have multiple bulges and this doesn't run in my family at all everyone in my family has a healthy normal back well into their 70's. also dry eyes and my hair has thinned out significantly. 4. The back pain just got more severe after I stopped and my eyes are now dry. they weren't dry on the drug. now i need to use drops constantly. my hair is much much thinner than it was 3 years ago this happened gradually. 5. yes dry eyes hair thinning back pain just getting worse over time 6. I can't workout lift things or even sit comfortably in a chair for more than 20 minutes. it hurts to drive or to lie down. i can't run and i used to be very active. basically the problems of a 70. yr old. 7. not at all my doctor told me at a normal dose all the side effects are mild and reversible. i thought this sort of thing could only happen after like 5 years that's what my doctor told me.. 8. my back has just been getting worse over the past 3 years since i stopped. 9. i use eyedrops but that doesn't fix it just manages it. i do physical therapy but it doesn't get rid of the back pain. i try stretches but again doesn't reverse damage to my spine.

During the course of the drug I got the lower back pain that most people get but after stopping the drug it never went away. It’s a chronic debilitating pain. 2) I took it over 3 years ago for a 6 month duration 3) Very dry skin and back pain 4) Constant lower back pain. I’ve gotten xrays mris and urine and blood tests done and they showed nothing. I’ve tried anti inflammatories chiropractors and physical therapy and still nothing. I fear that this pain will be with me for a lifetime. 5) No 6) It has made it very difficult to sit still in one place for more than 20 minutes leading me to struggle to focus in school and with getting work done. All I want to do is lie down to experience some relief. 7) Upon further research online after finishing my course of Accutane it appears many have similar stories to mine that I wish my physician had made me aware of

The drug hurt my son not me. It severely hurt his eyes brain ears joints and psychological state. 2. He stopped taking the drug 3.5 years ago. He is almost 19 not but took it at age 15. 4 months at 20mg/day was meant to go 9 months but we stopped early due to side effects. 3. While he was taking the drug he had dry lips and started experiencing horrific anger and rage towards the end. When we realized it was from taking accutane we stopped immediately but did not realize that the damage was already done. Reading these posts now I am grateful that we stopped when we did because it could have been a lot worse. 4. After he stopped the drug just a few days he developed horrible tinnitus in his ears. Then shortly after that he developed floaters in his eyes and what he described as a constant 'television static' in his visual field (visual snow). He became even more aggressive angry throwing and slamming things on the ground and even had a couple periods of psychosis that we had to hospitalize him for. A year later when having a conversation with him he explained to me that he'd been in pain since he stopped...at first he thought he was imaging it but the pain kept getting worse until he could no longer ignore it. Now he's in pain even when he does any basic exercise beyond walking. 5. Yes the mental symptoms occured when he was on the drug but the serious physical symptoms didn't occur until after he stopped taking the drug. 6. It has completely devastasted his life in ways a parent can only imagine in nightmares. My son is a shadow of himself and he lives in a shell of his previous happy go lucky self. I cannot believe what this poison did to him. 7. We were warned that 'some things could happen when he's on the drug' by his doctor but we were never told that the health issues could happen (and become permanent) after he stopped the drug. 8. His health issues have stayed pretty consistent (luckily haven't massively deteriorated like some others who comment) since about a month off the drug. He started declining just several days after quitting. 9. We try to get him to go to therapy and physical therapy but he is very very depressed. We have tried nutritional options but to no avail. We are a bit at a loss. Nothing is improving or getting worse. Please read this warning and consider what could happen to you or your loved one after taking this drug. Thank you for reading.

I'm fairly sure it made me nearsighted. No one in my family had myopia and I developed it. I went off Accutane and my prescription didn't change for a few years then I got back on it and my prescription immediately got stronger. I stopped it again forever and my prescription did not change again for a decade. Pretty strong correlation if you ask me. In the years since my myopia stayed pretty much the same and has even gotten a little better but now I need reading glasses. I guess I'm lucky if that's all it did to me.

Acne needs to be treated differently with a diet low in pasteurized dairy gluten and other carbs. You think that the drug just targets the mucus related to acne? It affects everything in the body. Some people ( majority ) get away with it. But there are a minority that have 9 lives ruined. Ban this drug. I don't have acne or any skin problems however I understand the appeal to something that seems too good to be true. Truth is it affects gut lining and back pain problem is because it makes it much harder for the muscles and tissues to get lubricated. They should ban this terrible drug. Hard drugs are better than this.

Which organ systems?** \ *Depression + Anger + Irritability* * Erectile dysfunction* I was 16 17 when I took it and had a normal puberty. I also had a girlfriend during this time and before taking it I had no problems getting it up or ejaculations) &#x200B; **How long ago did you take it? At what dose (if you can remember) and duration (how long you took it)?** * I took Accutane for 18 months from the age of 16 to 17 years old* * First 6 month dose was 20mg* * The remaining months were 50mg* &#x200B; **What were your side effects while you took the drug?** * No bodily fluids and ED* I had to constantly overhydrate myself and do crazy weight lifting to get one droplet of sweat. My skin was also constantly cracking and I began to use eczema cream to repair my skin. Regarding my ED even if I could get it (which was probably 1 2 times while taking this drug) I could never ejaculate and I still can't ejaculate to this day. This may or may not be related to Accutane but I believe it is. Before I took this medication I had no issues whatsoever. &#x200B; * Depression Anxiety and severe anger* I was a pretty normal child growing up and had my share of anger outbursts. But when I took accutane I was constantly depressed. I just got by in school slept during class and the moment I got home I just slept until the very next day. I would lash out on my mom all the time and I was super sensitive and controlling. When I got off Accutane I returned to normal. &#x200B; * Blood in my stool. LOTS of blood* Towards the middle of my prescription every bollow movement I had had blood. Everything was red. Sorry if this grosses anyone out but that was the reality. I told my dermatologist and she said that's normal. I wish I would have stopped taking it right away but being a teenager I didn't know any better. &#x200B; **What are your injuries/damage after you stopped taking the drug?** * Still battling with ED.* I've made leaps and bounds from when I started taking Accutane. I'm now 21 years old and I get morning wood 3 5 times a week.But when it's boom boom time comes it's always a challenge &#x200B; **Did additional harmful effects occur after yous stopped taking it?** * Nothing harmful after taking it.* Most of my side effects stopped after I stopped taking it. I never finished my prescription. One day I just had enough of the ED and sought out a men's clinic. They put me on HCG and it kinda helped &#x200B; **How has damage from this drug impacted your daily life (work hobbies abilities)?** Every intimate interaction with a girl. I haven't been in a relationship since high school but have been intimate with many girls. Problem is anytime I get to that point in a relationship I struggle to get it up. Then she thinks its her when it's me. I try my best to explain myself and a lot of the women I have dated were patient but eventually they got tired and left. So now i've been single and put a pause on dating until everything is fixed down there. I'm very close &#x200B; **Do you feel you were given proper informed consent about the long term risks and damage of this drug?** * Yes.* My doctor was a 60 year old dermatologist who thought she knew everything. Anytime I tried to bring up depression or my ED she shrugged it off and said that's unheard of. She also didn't raise an eyebrow when I had blood in my stool. She told me to just continue taking the medication. &#x200B; **Since you stopped taking accutane have your health issues stayed the same (as when you were on the drug) improved or gotten worse?** \ ED has improved I'd say Im back but at about 60% 70% \ Depression is gone but have mood swings just like the rest of us &#x200B; **What if anything have you done to manage your damage/symptoms? What has helped/hasn't helped?** I got lucky? Tbh I don't know what cured my ED. Maybe it was a diet change? I primarily eat keto with no grains. As for my depression I went through hours of counseling and some sexual therapy to get back in business.

In the begining as always it takes awhile for medicine to work so i didnt notice anything out of the ordinary. But every night i would stay awake dreading to pass out because it became clear to me that this was the last day of my life on earth and when i would pass out that was it enternal darkness. When i would wake up it would be a brief moment of joy that i had survived the night but then an overwhelming dread that this was the last day. It was like for the rest of the time on accutane. Until one morning i had this thought that all of the evil in me was in my heart and that i should use a kitchen knife to carve it out. This was so against my normal thought processes that i told my father who instantly knew what was up. I was taking to a therapist who talked about the depression side of accutane. Instantly stopped taking accutane and started taking Zoloft. That week i lost all of the dread and depression. ' When we talked with the dermatologist about taking accutane he had mentioned depression side effects. Asked my father if there were any isses with that in my familiy. He said no since no one on his side had it. Turns out my mothers side was all on anti depressants some due to acutane. I know i dont have the same crippling issues that most people on this sub do but had i not said anything or my parents taken quick action i wouldnt be here to say this to you. Side effects are serious shit.

Started accutane 80 mg away right off the bat in Dec 2019. I was only on this course for a little under 2 months. I started reading adverse side effect stories and was terrified because my eyes wear already suffering 1 month in. I'm glad I found you guys and stopped when I did. Honestly my adult onset acne wasnt bad enough for the Rx in the first place. I felt very uninformed by my derm and she never took my questions seriously. So I stopped on my own. During course one bilateral pink eye episode crusty dry upon waking red eyes. Now about 4 months post my eyes are still very dry. I'm thankful its doesnt seem as severe as alot of you here. I probably owe that to this sub. Hoping for continued improvement. Using moist compress lubricant drops eye massage and humidifier for relief. Hoping for an eye exam after quarantine. Also I have recently cured my acne through high quality probiotics supplements and DIM supplements. Also in retin A gel. So wish I never touched that evil stuff.

I was on 80mg and did 2 cycles of it. Can’t remember how long they were. I do remember carrying around sunscreen with me everywhere. As I got later in my teens I started having bouts of rage and depression. The rage and depression still is there today and I take medication for it. My skin is super sensitive to the sun and it feels like it is burning when the suns touches it. I get red in less than 30 minutes. I have had reconstructive surgery on both my shoulders. The only things I remember the doc saying to me is the severe birth defects that are possible.

My main damages are to my integumentary system eyes and brain. 2. I took 30 mg for one month and 60 mg for 3 months. 3. When I took the drug my skin was very dry and peeling. I also had dry eyes which had a lot of “goop” in them every morning when I woke up like a lot of it. I also developed unilateral conjunctivitis. I had very dry peeling lips and angular cheilitis. I developed staph infected weeping eczema on my course. My skin also tore off easily like paper leaving large wounds from a tiny scratch. My skin started to become sensitive toward the end of my course to the point where I tried to go to the beach and the ocean water stung my arms and legs. I was very sensitive to sunlight requiring abnormally large amounts of sunscreen to protect my skin. Finally my mental health issues started on my course with a few bouts of irrationally extreme anger to unideal but minor social problems. 4. My main problems after accutane are with very hot irritated and extremely hypersensitized facial skin and heat induced flushing/burning face hands and feet. My skin is particularly sensitized around my mouth which is a sensitive area to begin with and also an important area for eating and showing affect two ADLs that are now very uncomfortable for me. I have dandruff/very oily hair as well as itchy irritated scalp. I have increased hair loss and dry irritated eyes. My mental health really deteriorated including bouts of extreme anger and adrenaline as well as worsened BDD and OCD tendencies. I also have feminine dryness and itching as well as painful intercourse. 5. Although my skin was dry/sensitive on my course it was no where near the extent that it is now. The unbearable hypersensitivity irritation and even pain in my face all started about a week after I stopped taking the drug. My anger and rage as well as OCD accelerated about the same time too. My skin and eyes have decreased oil/lubrication production since I stopped taking the drug. I was told the oil would come back. 6. These changes to my body affected my life a lot. My anger problem damaged a lot of relationships in my life. I was really traumatized by all this and left graduate school to take some time to decrease stress. It hurt leaving my cohort and mentors; I feel like the drug stole my program from me. I constantly think about how to not anger my skin: this means changing the way I shower eat what I can apply to my face how long I can be in the sun if I can go swimming etc. I am constantly thinking about my skin condition and how to cool down my hot face. It would irritate my skin badly to kiss my boyfriend so we hardly kiss more than a small tap of the lips. Intercourse is also difficult with the dryness and pain. These changes affect my self esteem a lot. I often feel like I am an aged woman thinking back on what my body used to be like when in reality I am still a 22 year old young lady. I want to avoid social situations because I am not sure I will be able to easily get relief if my face overheats. So it is easiest to stay in where I know I will be able to go to the air conditioner or get ice when I need. This limits to the career path I may pursue. I started working from home due to this but I fear for my eyes always looking at screens. The only way to put it is that now I have to completely organize my life differently just to accommodate the changes the drug made to my body. 7. Absolutely not I didn’t even know the drug could affect body temperature regulation. I was also told everything was temporary and any changes would stop when I finished the drug. Additionally my acne was not bad at all and did not come close to warranting this medication. Many “doctors” are quick to give this medication and do not acknowledge the dangers of it which is extremely harmful and unprofessional. 8. As soon as I stopped taking accutane my issues became extremely severe. In the six months since then there have been some changes. I notice less swelling and redness of the face. But the throbbing irritation and dryness have gotten worse. The anger issue has gotten slightly better. 9. Changing my lifestyle like I explained above has helped me live with these changes. I have changed my diet to very bland soft healthier foods and nothing fried which also helps me manage my facial problems. I also started taking some supplements like MSM which I think helps a bit. But I still feel like I am in a completely different person’s skin than I was before accutane.

Everything started to feel dull and lifeless. Life felt like shit. Living/existing felt like a chore. 2 months in my attraction towards the opposite sex completely vanished. I went from hypersexual to feeling like an asexual eunuch. Couldn't get an erection either and I had two quarter sized lumps in both nipples full blown gynecomastia. None of these things I'd ever experienced in my life. I had feminine fat distribution aswell. Fat relocated around my hips/thighs. I looked fucking weird. My lust for life was reduced to nothing... i also became timid/much less alpha/manly. After I stopped my side effects were still there but i could still function as a human. Had a job etc. 1 year later I crashed all of my side effects were amplified by 100 it felt like plus the onser of new symptoms. I got gerd Ibs cold hands and feet brain fog debilitating fatigue joint pain lost muscle mass and bone mass I looked sickly and felt like it too. 5 years later. My sex drive/erections are back but my mental health is worse than ever. Absolutely horrible. Physical side effecrts some are gone some still remain. Gained my muscle/bone mass/general masculinity back...but I still have horrible ibs and gerd and cfs. I've probably spent over 2000$ on suppliments in an attempt to cure myself. I have mostly lost hope...idk what to do anymore.

So 1 year ago I took accutane for 6 months 2 months 40mg/day and the rest 80 mg/day. During that treatment the side effects I experienced was lower back pain and dry skin/lips. I also exercised heavily as I was a competitive soccer player which would worsen my lower back pain. My lower back pain went away a few months into the treatment. When I finished the treatment I didn’t have any side effects afterwards. However 6 months after finishing my acne came back. So I went on isotretinoin once again. I was only on it for about 3 weeks and 80mg/day. I stopped due to bug bites that I had for months that wouldn’t go away. Im in college so I had to do a video visit with my derm but she suspected that the the bug bites were infected so I should stop isotrenoin and take antibiotics (cephaxlin) for one week. I took the antiobiotics but the bug bites didn’t go heal so they are likely not infected. After finishing the antibiotics I didn’t resume the isotrenoin as I wanted to wait for the bug bites to heal. And almost two months later the bites still haven’t healed I am waiting to go back home so that I can see my derm in person. Now I’ll talk about possible symptoms while I was on isotretinoin the second time (which was only for 3 weeks). I got lower back pain like last time. I also had severe neck discomfort that would worsen while sitting but improve while laying down. I also got shoulder discomfort which was accompanied by grinding noise. Lastly I got a dull upper back ache and lots of cracking. I think I may have strained my neck and upper back as that’s what it felt like— I had acute pain that went away after several days but I still have a dull ache two months later. When I stopped the isotretinoin my lower back pain completely went away. My neck discomfort significantly improved but is still somewhat present. The noises from my shoulder changed from grinding to more of snapping and clicking noise which also happen less. My upper back ache is still dull but maybe a little better than before and cracking also may have lessened a little. I also noticed that I started having cracking in my sternum such as when I took deep breathes. Also it is important to note that I have a history of neck discomfort but the upper back and shoulder pain is completely new. So I can’t tell if these new issues with my upper back shoulders and worsening with my neck is actually due to accutane. Since I have taken accutane before I didn’t experience those symptoms the first time I was on it the only one I did have was lower back pain in which I had again while on accutane the second time but that lower back pain went away after stopping. So to me it doesn’t make since for my lower back pain to be gone but not my other joint pain if it was actually due to accutane. Also my neck shoulder and upper back have been very slowly improving over time it’s been two months since stopping accutane. I have read about people experiencing joint cracking because of accutane but all of them had widespread joint cracking. The only consistent and new joint cracking I have is in my upper back and sternum. Other than isotrenoin I have suspicion that my joint problems can be due to the bug bites that still haven’t healed (maybe reactive arthritis) or maybe just due to anxiety. Around the same time that I started accutane and joint problems began I was the most anxious and stressed I have been in my entire life and I am still anxious today. I am anxious about my bug bites not healing and the unknown causes of my joint problems so until those resolve or I have answers I think i’ll continue to be stressed. So for me I don’t know if accutane is to blame for my problems especially since I only took it for 3 weeks the second time and I reacted pretty well to it the first time I took it and the usual lower back pain went away as soon as i stopped taking it. So to me it wouldn’t make sense that if my joint pain was caused by accutane that they should all be at the same state either all gone or all still be present not some gone and some still there. Also my joint pain has been very slowly improving and not getting worse there is also no new pain that came after stopping accutane. I am still able to play soccer and weight lift the only issue I notice while exercising is my upper back cracking and shoulder snapping noises but no pain. So I can still function with my joint problems and it isn’t dehabilitating but it is still something that I have in my mind constantly which does distract my focus. Also what doesn’t make sense is that if I were to have many joint side effects from accutane I feel that it would’ve happened while I was on accutane the first time. I was exercising a lot while on it the first time which I know you are not suppose to do. On the other hand I didn’t exercise really at all when I was accutane the second time. So maybe the upperback shoulder and worsening of neck pain was coincidental and actually caused by something else.I just wanted to share my story thanks for reading I know it is long and very confusing so I am open to answer any questions. There is also probally some information or more to the story that I left out to shorten this post. I am going to see my a spine and joint specialist and derm in a few weeks.

Severe back pain especially in the lower back. I literally feel like an 80 year old woman and I’m only 20. I have bad sciatica now because of it. The first round I took the drug my side effects went away. However after taking it a second round most side effects stayed and never went away. It’s been over 1yr since I stopped it now. 2. I’ve been off of it for over 1yr now. Never had acne issues again but the side effects stayed. 3. Dry eyes dry skin chapped and crusted lips joint pain rashes at times sensitive skin 4. Sciatica lower back pain dry eyes dry lips dry skin (and this is coming from someone who has oily skin and hair) all my joints pop in weird places and make cracking noises 5. See #4 above 6. I have bad sciatica now that affects my athletic life. I literally sloth around some days because my lower back pain is so bad even though I am a highly active person. I go to the chiropractor frequently for pinches nerves also. 7. I do feel like I was mostly given proper informed consent about the long term risks and damage of the drug.

It’s just my joints that pop all the time and excruciating lower back and sciatica. 9. I go to the chiropractor and taken Tylenol sometimes. Stretching helps also but none of this ever provides long term relief.

So far as I can tell Accutane may have disturbed my hormonal balance mental health (extreme depression and mood swings worse than ever before) it has definitely harmed my muscles and joints (recurring pain for no reason) my gut health my sexual organ health (loss of sensation and very little self lubrication) brain fog and memory problems extreme sensitivity to caffeine and alcohol. 2. I stopped my second round of Accutane after about 3 months in October of 2020. My 1st round lasted 6 months in 2019. Both were low dosages as that was all I could stand due to extreme emotional side effects. 3. Side effects while on the medication were loss of libido extreme depression and irritability constipation joint pain extreme thirst dry skin eyes and lips. 4. Still discovering the exact damage but experiencing very concerning sexual side effects and also discovered Methane Dominant SIBO in my gut from small intestine bacterial overgrowth and still trying to resolve that. My acne came back worse than it was before this time on my neck where it had never been before and developed as huge cystic bumps. 5. Yes my emotional wellness has not recovered and has been hell. My gut health has been hell. My sexual side effects have gotten much worse over time after stopping the medication. 6. I can no longer enjoy 2 of my favorite things about life like I used to: sex and food. I also have consistent back and joint pain that I never had before. 7. No. I was never told about sexual side effects that may be permanent such as a loss of sensation. 8. Issues have been a roller coaster and I would say have gotten worse but I am working towards healing them with a naturopathic physician which is helping slightly. 9. Addressing my acne and health problems with a naturopathic physician has been very helpful. I am still doing tests to figure out and address my sexual dysfunction issues. I got Dutch complete hormone testing done and am taking supplements & medications to address my hormonal imbalances. I got tested for SIBO and am being treated for Methane Dominant SIBO. I am on supplements and now Wellbutrin for emotional wellness. High doses of Ahwaghanda and liver detox support supplements have helped greatly.

I have been on it since the end of march 2022 I have suffered from mild cystic acne for the last 2 years I would say. I have noticed my face clearing up it definitely did get worse before it got better and I plan to stay on it until my face is clear but as a heavier person the dosage isn’t as effective on me so my derm told me I would have to stay on it for longer. I believe that even though the side effects it has given me I will do anything for clear skin and to never have acne again it has severely impacted my self image and confidence. After about a month of accutane I had the usual dry skin chapped lips joint pain dry eyes redness of face but with that also came severe acid reflux first thing in the morning when I woke up. I threw up every single morning sometimes multiple times in one morning for months. I told my dermatologist this and she prescribed me omeprazole after taking it I was still throwing up but she had told me that it takes about a month for it to fully “kick in” after a month I was still throwing up however it was significantly less maybe only once ever other week now I rarely ever throw up. When I started accutane I was 270 lbs I now am 205. I believe accutane has majorly effected my appetite and relationship with food. I used to eat 3 solid meals a day including snacks and desert and more snacks now I have to force myself to eat something before I go to bed so my stomach will stop growling. I can not stomach food and find it hard to eat literally anything nothing is appetizing. Honestly I’m in a headspace where I’m ignoring these symptoms in order to achieve clear skin which I know is unhealthy but I hate myself with acne.

Cessation of long bone growth.. I grew (height) early so in that regard I'm lucky but could've grown more I guess it's happened with some of my family but I've been the exact same width and size since high school which is so sad and hilarious to look back at pictures when we took it and how everyone was so narrow and looked like kids and flash forward 13 years and my shoulders or torso haven't widened at all.. Chalk it up to no clavicle growth from 17 25.. Hair thinned while on it. Like immediate not falling out. It thinned all of the follicles and changed the texture of my hair.. That was the most debilitating at first because the bone growth and later ulcerative colitis weren't known about Have never had as supple skin since the course of the drug.. The whole thing has just been debilitating.. I wrinkled earlier than friends but all fine lines.. Assuming due to dry dehydrated skin. My hair was so nice before and it's never really thinned since but just so thin and flowy now.. It's really depressing if I think about it and especially when I'm in a room of adults (I'm 30 now) and every single person that I used to be bigger than in high school is now wider than me and looks more masculine.. Everyone in my family actually has really broad shoulders including my mom and her whole side.. It's just really depressing

Four weeks after taking accutane at 21 years old had a full adrenal failure seizures developed IBS C that they thought was chron’s. It wasn’t it was Addison’s Disease. I lost my peripheral vision for about 4 months heavy anxiety attacks and panic attacks daily no ability to have sex or even masturbate more than once every 10 days due to ED. Dropped out of college to figure all this out stayed at my parent’s house and resumed some of my life/college very poorly about 2 years later. 2. I took a normal dose of accutane for 4 weeks. 3. I couldn’t use the bathroom properly. I felt like my brain was changing. Felt it moving around in my head. Fell asleep for 2.5 days like I had mono woke up to piss a few times. After sleeping that long I went outside and sat on a park bench for a 6 hours and my friends found me just staring off. 4. Addison’s Disease IBS C Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and severe anxiety from nervous system damage. My cortisol levels were extremely low my testosterone at 22 years old was 130. 5. No. After significant work on diet eastern and wester medicine — it took about 6 years to recover 50%. It took about 9 years to get to about 90%. After 11 years I still take medicine for hydrocortisone TRT and have high blood pressure from it but have a solid quality of life. 6. Dropped out of college. Was able to finish late about 2 years later but with a 2.8 GPA. I was previous a 4.1 GPA student in high school. I also couldn’t take a standard job after graduating due to chronic fatigue and anxiety so I worked for myself and found clients through mentorship. Taking accutane totally altered my career trajectory but I see this professional aspect as a blessing in disguise as I recovered from it. For example in college I couldn’t pass a basic computer course. Through my recovery process and progressive experience in my own independent work 7 years later I was consulting the computing aspects of a surgical robotics project. In college could sustain the energy to go to the gym maybe once per week. 11 years later at 33 years old I’m at the gym about 5x week. I just hit my max bench press. Same weight as in college. 7. No way. My dermatologist was shocked by what happened to me. 8. My damage stayed the same until I took control and improved it myself. It has taken a lot of work through a strict diet labs corticosteroids TRT strict habits with alcohol and exercise 9. After being in and out of the ER Ive met with many doctors in the last 10 years (including the inventor of accutane who has a practice in Dublin Ohio and regrets every selling the drug to La Roche). I met with a Researcher who was a NueroEndoImmunoChronologist and had a pain care clinic with bio feedback and advanced testing protocols. I’ve became my specialist and primary doctor for 10 years until retiring. My treatment process has been strict but effective. I’ve coached a couple others who had similar symptoms as me (low energy panic anxiety low performance in school work low drive erectile distinction low cortisol stomach issues related to constipation or food intolerance) through this but to recover you have to strictly follow the tenants of the plan: A) Strict Anti Inflammatory Diet (For me 3 years of this strict diet to get 50% energy and performance back) B) Removing Fructose and as much Sugar from Diet as possible Immediately C) No alcohol except for Red Wine D) Labs for Cortisol (Salivary Cortisol Test) E) If low cortisol beginning Cortef F) Labs for testosterone G) If low testosterone and/or high estrogen beginning TRT and anastrozole. Monitoring labs every 3 months. H) Put porn blockers or filters on porn for a while with accountability (2 months+) I) Exercise progressively at the gym. Once per 2 weeks. Then once per week. Then 2x per week. J) Accupuncture for Anxiety and IBS C K) Gabapentin for Anxiety (300mg if needed)

Heart problems irregular heart rate/palpitations. When exercising my pulse gets off beat. Have been told I have mild supraventricular tachycardia. Still waiting on a cardiologist for echo and stress test. 2. I took 40 mg from September 2022 January 2023. Have been off it now 2 months. 3. Side effects of heart palpitations and flutters starting the month after I went on accutane went to the ER twice for chest discomfort chest pain shortness of breath and arrhythmia. 4. Ongoing arrhythmia and irregular pulse. 5. No additional harmful effects after stopping other than lethargy and trouble sleeping. 6. I struggle to do things that raise my heart rate although I've been told the irregular beat isn't dangerous or straining to my heart it's really uncomfortable. I used to love going to gigs exercising regularly and being spontaneous. I rarely leave the house anymore and when I do I don't enjoy the activities because I'm hyper aware of my heart. 7. No I wasn't only found out that this was a side effect others had after searching on Reddit and through academic articles. My doctor tried to tell me accutane wasn't related even though it started only after taking the drug. 8. It hasn't gotten any better not gotten worse either but I've stopped doing many things that trigger the problems. 9. I stopped doing lots of stuff that I enjoy went back on ssris because I thought my anxiety might be the problem. They made the arrhythmia worse and I ended up in the ER after the arrhythmia episode lasted more than 30 mins. When I got to the ER the nurse could feel my irregular pulse but it stopped before they did an ecg. I stopped taking the ssris and it happens less.

I am Hypermobile and I truly believe that Accutane weakened my muscles/bones/joints. I have so many health problems that a 23 year old shouldn't have. I also run a super fast heart rate for my age. Suspected POTS and EDS. 2. I was on it for 5 years on and off through the ages of 11 and 16. I went from the minimum to the maximum dose so I have had it all 3. I believe there were absolutely environmental factors to this and my family was a major contributor but it worsened my depressive and suicidal thoughts at 14. My parents caught my scars and my dermatologist made me see a psych before I could continue. The first antidepressants I was on reacted with the accutane and made me Ill 24/7. My skin was forever dry I could wear sunscreen and reapply and still get burnt. I could barely do anything without my muscles hurting extremely the next day or even within a few hours. I'm sure there was more but this period is somewhat a blur in certain aspects. 4. Muscle and joint damage I believe. I do not have the stamina that I should at my age. Even walking up a hill has me almost passing out and in pain. 5. I cannot remember immediately after it sorry 6. I can't have an exercise routine. People think I am just weak andif I just exercised regularly I would be fitter. I had to change jobs because my body physically couldn't keep up with what was required of it 7. I do remember my mum thinking about it for a second and then me being a bit anxious about it but I was 11 so I didn't really know 8. Skin is not as bad as when I was 11 but it still gets pretty fucking awful. Hurts to smile do normal activities kinda awful. I don't sunburn as easily and my skin isn't as dry 9. Still figuring this one out

I doubt anyone goes into taking accutane expecting to experience the rare side effects that people mention here. Also it's easy for people to label this as fear mongering because it so strongly goes against their beliefs about the drug but it's doesn't disprove the fact that these things could happen (although probably unlikely). As for the guy claiming to be a doctor. Doctor's make mistakes all the time and aren't guaranteed to know everything about a drug. Why do you think it took so long for Thalidomide to get taken off the market? How many children were born with severe deformities before doctors and governments finally recognized that the drug was the problem? Edit: a word

It is sadly far too common. I am glad CBD helps you. What dose do you take? I am curious which side effects made you need to stop your course early you said that you couldn’t finish but also said you only had dry skin and lips while on the drug and then developed everything later on? The part that is not discussed by doctors is how the damage can happen much much later on and I hope they will add this to labels soon for people to understand better.

Retinoic acid taken orally is quite literally pure poison. If you're a doctor you should really know much better than to think that OD'ing on isotretinoin is by any means safe. Just like with other chemotherapy drugs the effects can often hit you after you've stopped treatment. This isn't uncommon; patients being fine on treatment then their bodies falling apart afterwards. I hope you treat your own patients better than you treat yourself. You don't even have severe acne thus should never have qualified to take this.

I continued taking it though because I figured I'd want to at least get something out of it (my skin is indeed clear rarely get acne if ever now) but I also didn't think much of it at the time until I started putting two and two together. Hair loss I honestly can't remember I had extremely thick hair and probably didn't notice significant loss until a couple years after. No one is more than a norwood 1 in my family btw. I guess I'm more of a stereotypical case in which the symptoms happened during the drug and have just lingered ever since. The only positives to come out of accutane is clear skin + hyper awareness of taking drugs now. I truly believe I probably would have experimented with fin at some point after typical hairline maturation. However I will never touch that now thanks to accutane. Definitely an optimistic take there but it helps with the coping.

At the time I didn't associate it with Accutane. My acne came back when I was 30 though not as severe my derm prescribed it for me once again and I was happy to have it work its magic. The clinic I was going to was a med school so I'd see a new derm every visit. At some point the pharmacy was unable to fill my script and I missed 30 days but resumed once I saw my derm again. After finishing the course which took another month I began to have some minor back pain but at this point I thought it was just my bed. My last derm visit I asked if I could restart it if the acne came back but my derm very animatedly warned me not to do that and told me horror stories about patients who developed these issues. After a few more weeks the back pain grew more intense until finally almost overnight it became unbearable. I also had severe GI upset that I won't get into that coincided with the back pain. The rest is history. I now use a wheelchair and am in severe constant pain and am unable to maintain my weight. I sit here at 94lbs (started at 180lbs) in a ridiculous amount of pain. Not saying this to scare you. There are very many people who won't ever experience these side effects even with a gap in their treatment so don't stress too much about it just don't stop then restart your treatment without talking to your derm. Read the literature that comes with your pills it'll give you a similar warning not to stop/restart. Edit: I'm letting you know this so you don't decide to stop treatment on your own after reading these stories from people who've experienced the worst of it. Edit2: To answer your question more directly I don't know if it was the gap in my treatment that caused my issues or not but it sounds like others have had similar issues without a gap.

You are part of the problem why people struggle to make fully informed decisions about taking this drug. You're also part of the reason why people who are suffering from severe side effects even after discontinuation of the drug struggle to be recognized by medical professionals. I had just turned 17 when I was asked by my derm to take Accutane. At first I said no and was told that it was a safe drug to take. I ended up changing my mind because of 1.) me trusting my derm and 2.) people like you who label those with negative experiences as idiots. My life has never returned to normal since taking that drug and I will always regret trusting my derm and letting myself be swayed by ignorant comments such as yours. I know at the end of the day it's my fault but as a 17 year old at the time what could I expect I was led to believe that those who did suffer severe reactions were all lunatics.

It's people like these judgemental pricks on the internet and our doctors who we trust that are to blame for making us feel as if accutane is safe..so then we take it. r/accutane is a dangerous forum because it promotes this idea that accutane is safe but has only 'rare' side effects and that anyone suffering after accutane is just crazy and needs to be dismissed.

The first course while I was taking it I had sensitivity to light my skin flaked quite a bit my lips were severely chapped and a bit into the treatment I became incredibly incredibly depressed. It felt like a blanket of darkness just fell over me. It felt very medicated too hard to explain the feeling. I also had some hair loss. That all went away when I stopped taking it. The more recent course I had similar issues while on it except for the depression I didn't feel that this time. The hair loss however was more noticeable. I lost a good chunk in a matter of a couple weeks. That never grew back. Aside from that I developed some kind of psoriasis or something on my head. Very thick greasy flakes but otherwise no pain or any other signs things were headed in that direction. To answer your question about why this happened. Some drugs have side effects some drugs can cause musculoskeletal deformities GI issues etc. Will it happen to everyone? No. I don't know why it happened to me. The 30 day gap makes the most sense from my perspective.

First I wanted to look into it more though as I’ve heard the horror stories here and there. Safe to say I’m 99% discouraged from trying this treatment for my acne. I wish there was a better answer but it looks like I’ll just have to suffer with poor health and bad skin forever as the cost of making my situation worse is too much to bear.

AccutaneDamage,hj64ne,An ACCUTANE Video 9 minutes watch and share.,,A raw food diet cannot destroy your gut. It is the best way to give your gut a chance to heal from the damage you have done to it. I do not know your medical history so cannot tell you what destroyed your gut. To heal you need to take the toxic load off your body and the average diet of today is constantly increasing your toxic load not relieving it. If you have acne or any other skin disease it means your system is overwhelmed by toxins and trying to expel them through the skin. A very simple fruit based diet is the best way to take the toxic load off your system. The problem is at the time you started the diet your body was already toxic your gut was already damaged and you are misattributing symptoms of that damage to natural foods. Whole natural foods cannot harm your body for the simple reason they are not toxins. Most likely what you experienced was the uncomfortable symptoms of your body beginning to detoxify the damage it has suffered. If you do not stick with the diet long enough to get past the detox period you will not reap the rewards. Do not come to any conclusions about whether the diet has helped you or not for at least two months. If you took Accutane or antibiotics or other drugs they would definitely have destroyed your gut. While doing a raw food diet you need to avoid taking in all toxins that poison your system drugs alcohol and poisons of every kind including OTC garbage like advil. You also need to understand what you are doing if you lack a good orientation to understand what I am talking about please read books on the subject and consult with an experienced guide who can help you understand the benefits of a raw fruit diet and raw fruit juice fasting. Under no circumstances will a raw food diet harm your gut or harm you body. The diet to follow I need to stress should consist almost entirely of raw fruit.

Made it *normal.* Tretinoin just made me constantly purge. I have experienced no side effects from accutane other than very dry peeling lips and mildly flaky skin. It did not exacerbate my health problems. It’s been 1 000% worth it. Unfortunately it didn’t give me long term acne remission the first time and my skin relapsed so I’m on it again.
AccutaneDamage,hj64ne,An ACCUTANE Video 9 minutes watch and share.,,I have had just about zero side effects and am now over a month in! Only side effects I have are very chapped lips and moderately drier eyes. My hair isn’t falling out I’m not crippled with joint or back pain (despite having DJD in my spine) I have no abdominal pain or digestive issues despite having IBS (which is basically in remission) my Interstitial Cystitis and vulvodynia are not worse my libido is not completely dead and best of all my skin is finally starting to get better despite my chronic picking disorder (dermatillomania)! I would say 100% worth it so far. All the scary things I read deterred me for so many years but the mental burden of acne finally put me over the edge. Life is too short to have this monkey on our backs any longer!

I am going to find a dermatologist and just pull the trigger on it.
AccutaneDamage,hj64ne,An ACCUTANE Video 9 minutes watch and share.,,I’m sorry but I literally ended up with severe debilitating chronic abdominal pain at 19 years old after desperately following advice from internet gurus who claimed raw vegan / fruitarian was the cure and I’m not going take gaslighting about it sitting down. Not from that self assured idiot or any other idiot for that matter. There I called them an idiot at the end this time and you read my whole comment!
AccutaneDamage,hj64ne,An ACCUTANE Video 9 minutes watch and share.,,If you’re suffering so terribly because of it think it would be 100% worth it for you too. My acne is considered mild moderate (was much worse as a teen but never completely went away) and it still affects me very deeply. For example there have been many times in which I wanted to go for a walk on a beautiful day I’m a nature lover and have decided not to because of my skin. Because the chance of running into even one person and feeling ashamed of how I looked was too much. Mind you the trails near me aren’t super busy at most you’ll run into 2 or 3 people during the warmer months. Every summer I feel so disgusting when I go to the nearby beach (which is my favorite place) without makeup. Even worse any physical activity outdoors in the warmer months causes me to develop clogged pores / blackheads almost immediately. Like clockwork my skin is congested and oily as soon as it’s nice out which makes me want to stay inside all day. It also triggers ongoing Derma episodes which cause discoloration and scarring. It’s hell honestly. This summer I’m hoping that for the first time since I was 12 I won’t feel ashamed of the state of my face. I’m sure you know what I’m talking about. If I finally decided it’s worth the risk (and trust me I know what the risk is) then I think you should too. My only regret right now is that I didn’t do it sooner I’m 24 now and if I could go back and do it at 20 I 100% would! I’m kicking myself rn for being so afraid.

AccutaneDamage,hj64ne,An ACCUTANE Video 9 minutes watch and share.,,Yeah i am taking your advice then i can sit here and be afraid of the side effects but that isn’t going to fix my acne. My doctor said that my case is severe acne and that this stuff is my only option. But I just didn’t trust the fact that he said I have to get blood test done every week to monitor my levels of everything. But then again staying like this isn’t an option either. Acne fucked us up pretty bad when it comes to mental health. I hope everything goes well for you and may you one day have clear skin.
AccutaneDamage,hj64ne,An ACCUTANE Video 9 minutes watch and share.,,Yes I understand your concern over the blood tests some people’s livers don’t handle the drug well which is why you get tested every month so if you are one of those people you may stop the drug or decrease your dose to avoid damage. My liver results were in the normal range this past month despite having to take Percocet with Tylenol several times a week for chronic pain. I took NAC 3x a day which I believe really helped if you’re concerned about your liver I highly recommend using that it’s one of the only useful things I got out of all my years diving into natural medicine

He told me the depression issue could be argued but that he personally didn’t believe Accutane was the cause of depression. And yes he asked me if I was interested in Accutane before I even started treatment for my acne; he said he’d let his kids take it if they wanted to and I trust this man because he’s helped my family through a lot of skin issues.

To put this straight: these doctors have dedicated their entire business model SOLELY for the purpose of handing out accutane like CANDY to children teens and adults no office visits needed no prior acne treatments needed. They are distributing the most despicable disgusting toxic chemotherapy treatment to whoever wants it. Literally calling their website ""get vitamin A"" PURPOSELY misleading youth into believing that this chemo drug is merely just a vitamin nothing more nothing dangerous. On their website they deny IBS and depression as being proven side effects saying they are ""very debatable and unproven"" in essence telling overt lies and gas lighting all who have suffered from this heinous drug which is an overt crime against humanity destroying and disabling our youth in the masses.

For 1.5 months I've been doing no vitA diet and it's working and I feel much better. Alcohol will accelerate vitA release from the liver. Some commons foods with no vitA: Red meat White rice Peanuts Cauliflower Most fruits have vitA however meyer lemons do not.

AccutaneDamage,hi8qfj,Low vitamin A diet?,Can someone explain this to me or give me a link on what to eat and what not to eat? Also have any of you had any success with this and getting rid of long term side effects? Thank you!,"Overall I haven't really improved other than my ability to cope with it and exercising when I can which has helped somewhat. Granted I am extremely injury prone now and can only do certain exercises as my joints/knees/spine/etc. have gotten even worse over time. Long term issues are almost zero libido with permanent reduction in flaccid and BPEL length/girth back/knee/joint issues eye issues (night vision sucks now) and hair loss while on drug (norwood 0 before taking it norwood 3 now). I also believe it led to my long term stomach (not colon) issues which now requires yearly endoscopies but I cannot confirm this. I am 28 by the way. Mentally I'm fine now as I've learned to cope and exercise assists with this as well. Took a while to reach the acceptance stage. At this point I don't bother thinking about the ""what if"" anymore. The worst thing you can do for this is researching and joining these kinds of communities because you'll never be satisfied in the end. You'll still have your issues but you'll also destroy yourself mentally which is even worse."

Also have any of you had any success with this and getting rid of long term side effects? Thank you!,I’m sorry to hear that. I hope one day you start to improve. I’ve done quite a bit of research and asked quite a lot of other people who have been on the drug how they got rid of their side effects. Most my side effects disappeared within two months of being off the drug however I was left with dry lips and dry rough skin on my face in the last 6 months my lips have improved massively probably only need lip balm once a month dry skin on face is still quite bad but not too noticeable I feel like I’m really close to finally being fully over the side effects so just trying to find out what could help me get the last of the way there. Hoping in the next year my lips will be fully back to normal as they have been improving so much recently.

I do believe part of this is mental although it's clear that some people are affected a lot worse than others regardless of mental health. I'm not going to deny a part of it is mental though and perhaps not even related to accutane.

Blaccutane,148g9ee,Nervous Milia Removal,I'm having the milia on my right cheek removed on June 27. (BTW I've had the milia long before Accutane and my acne breakouts.) I trust my dermatologist completely. She's freaking amazing. She advised me to use my hydroquinone twice daily on the area 2 weeks before the procedure to prevent PIH and to stay inside as much as possible and wear hats while they heal. I don't want to start over with the fading process on my cheek but I **HATE** the way the milia look. They look like a cluster of pimples. I will be 99% happy with my overall Accutane journey without them. I want them gone!! Ughhh!!!!,Sending you love and light. You’re so beautiful I remember your pictures.

Blaccutane,147k2p8,Skincare tips,Hey everyone! I just finished my 2nd month on accutane (2nd time I’ve been on it as well) and my progress is not where I thought it would be. The first time round my skin had pretty much cleared up by month 2 and it hasn’t. I know this can happen but I wanted to get some tips from you all. I was wondering if I could some tips for what moisturizer and cleanser I should use I never know which one to get. Right I wash my face my african black soap 3 times a week at night and the rest of the times I just wash it with water. As my moisturizer I use a Aloe Vera everyday. Which products should I get? My skin used to be oily and now it has dried out which is good so I would love some recommendations for dry skin. Also on the accutane reddit they always mention the importance of sunscreen. Does that apply to us too? If so which one should I get because I’m out in the sun a lot. I live in Europe btw. Thank you again!,I think the black soap is too harsh imo

Use a gentle cleanser twice a day. I cannot stress this enough but wearing sunscreen is the most important step in any routine. And drinking drinking a lot of water.

Blaccutane,145dyuo,Amnesteen/Mobility Loss,Has anyone else experienced this? I had to stop my medication two weeks in because I couldn't walk anymore due to severe knee joint pain. I healed 4 days after I stopped my prescription. I didn't have Meg knees to begin with but this was bad. I just want clear skin 😩,I had that when I worked out or took long walks. Stretching really helped for me.

I wasn't taking up to 2800mg of Fish Oil and I'm probably not drinking enough water. I go back to the dermatologist next week so I may have to decrease my dosage.

Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Yes!!! It will and it’s the reason I was on three months longer. Absorbica is way better and to save you my headache and heartache start taking 2400 2800 mg of fish oil with each dose daily
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Two different brands didn’t change anything but I was never on Absorbica.
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Thank you! I agree because I think I’m done purging & my face looks completely different compared to month 1. Did you purge again when you switched?
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Did you ever make a change w/ in accutane brands?
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Yes I did badly! And I had to start the fish oil but I didn’t do that for at least three months of struggle and ugliness. I was in so much pain I could barely walk. Someone on here suggested fish oil and of course increase water intake. I did that and finally 11 months later I got off of the accutane. Now I’m slowly fading hyperpigmentation that no doubt is worse because I was taken off Absorbica and now I have to get peels. I got one it did nothing and I didn’t even peel. Next up in July I’ll get a higher strength. Hoping that ends this whole process. I’m also on arazlo which is gentler than tret and it’s seems promising
Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,Yes. I started with Amneal then Claravis and back to Amneal.

Blaccutane,145cy65,Prescription,Hey y’all! i’m going into my 3rd month of accutane but they switched my prescription brand from absorica to regular accutane. Do y’all think different brand names will make a difference?,It wasn’t as effective because I wasn’t ingesting enough fat. Vitamin A is a fat soluble vitamin so save yourself the headache and take the fish oil and a spoonful of peanut butter or ice cream.
Accutane,1hqykqa,"New Additions to Low Efforts; ""SHOULD I GO ON ACCUTANE?""",Please remember this is Reddit and we are strangers. Posts asking if one should start Accutane without a picture of the user's skin and/or a brief summary of one's acne struggles will be removed. No one here is qualified to assess you for Accutane and you should first see a doctor or dermatologist to assess your condition.,Thankkkk yooouuu. So annoying!! Only a derm will be able to tell you if it is a good option.
Accutane,1hqykqk,Do not solicit medical advice,"First and foremost a happy new year to everyone. With the new year we will be much stricter on the do not solicit medical advice rule. We know many people going ""Just looking for experiences (:"" are looking to circumvent doctor's advice. It is a thinly veiled attempt at ""if he or she did it I can too."" Everyone is different and has a different medical history so you should always first and foremost consult your doctor or derm. Things that generally constitute medical advice include: \ Anything that could break your skin including extractions lasers waxing etc. \ Any use of PRESCRIPTION medications(oral or topical) \ Surgery related(HELLO YOU REALLY WANT A STRANGER TO ADVISE YOU ON SURGERY?) \ Starting and/or stopping a MEDICATION. Your accutane is prescribed by a doctor. If you have conerns about taking or ceasing a medication you should consult a medical professional(ie doctor or pharmacist) and not the internet. \ IS THIS DOSE TOO HIGH OR LOW? \ Interpreting of lab/test results. This is clearly specialized knowledge and if you would not consult a hobo about your lab results you most clearly should not consult Reddit. \ Oh my doctor said not to worry but... Reddit in most situations should not supercede your doctor's medical advice. Ultimately it will always be at the mod's discretion and we were not born yesterday. You would surprised at how many crazy posts have had to be removed.",No comments

It’s 95% of the time hormonal. If your issue is hormonal as well here are things that have worked for me. 1. Birth Control. Takes about 3 months to really kick in. 2. Curology. 3. Spironolactone. This is a good option if you don’t want to take birth control. 4. Differin. I’m 41/F. I had it as a teen and then it came back in my 30’s. I am currently on birth control and I use Differin. Totally free of acne at this point. Hope this helps!

Accutane is too aggressive your skin isnt bad enough and i dont think a derm would suggest it. 2. Birth control worked for me but then my body adjusted and i probably had clear skin for a year. What I did notice is one if your cheeks looks a little more affected than the other. This happened to me when my pillows werent clean all the time. I suggest washing it every 3 days to a week and your sheets weekly. Try panoxyl face/body wash or antibacterial soap unscented. If you like swimming i also recommend that just make sure to moisturize. If not a chemical peel should do wonders as well im getting my first one in a month.
acne,1iw1me9,Advice on dealing with acne ? I feel like I’ve tried everything but nothing works for me,The last photo is most recent and second is about 3 months ago so I’ve definitely seen improvement with skin texture from using over the counter retinol but my acne itself remains. I’m not really sure why diet wise I’ve been eating low sugar/rarely eat out and get greasy foods. I track my water intake/etc My skincare routine mostly looks like this: AM: gentle gel face cleanser or salicylic acid cleanser (depending on how sensitive my skin is feeling) niacinamide serum cream moisturizer (since I have sensitive skin that tends to get dry around this time of year) spf PM: oil cleanser niacinamide serum 1% retinol (used every other day to prevent sensitivity) snail mucin moisturizer cream moisturizer,Accutane is the only thing that ever worked for me

I haven’t tried warm packs before but that’s a good idea my pimples are usually red like this when they’re new but it helps when I stick a pimple patch over it. My biggest issue are the dark spots that come after the pimples healed and the once my dark spots are almost healed I get even more pimples 😓

Though sometimes you will get mood swings and will get irritated very frequently and I remember I became very emotional and used to cry at every little thing I also got slight IBS during accutane and it was totally my mistake I ate maggie (white flour noodles) without any veggie and drank less water that day. So the next morning on the toilet I had trouble pushing the poop out and hence got a fissure. Once my accutane stopped my intestine went back to normal so folks if you’re on ANY medication make sure to eat a lot of veggies and drink atleast 2.5 L of water/day. PS: my skin looks better than ever everyone compliments me now no new acne I’ve never been this happy. I only apply moisturizer to my face every night and use cleanser before sleeping. The wait was worth it the purging was worth it. Also while on accutane stay away from the mirror for a few months you’ll feel better about yourself. :)

acne,1iwa1au,Pimples every night,Every day when I wake up I have pimples in my cheeks and forehead I’m doing a routine skin care with Effaclar and a balanced diet can somebody help me.,Maybe you are allergic on something that may trigger your pimples. You can apply some cream to reduce and clear it I may not fond of skin care but found some good results of using skinfix especially my friend of mine. Maybe you can try it
acne,1iw4vyh,This is killing me how do I get this to stop??,On on Testosterone and I keep getting constant deep painful acne that ends up scarring whether I mess with it or not. It's prone to getting super sensitive and agitated. Was prescribed benzoyl peroxide which didn't end up helping took a break and tried just about every product you can imagine and then just this year got prescribed azaelic acid which also isn't helping at all unfortunately. I need to get rid of this acne it's so painful at times I can't sleep on either side of my face plus it's just really embarrassing to have as an adult.,Testosterone/androgens is what causes hormonal acne what worked for me was Differin. I have recently started using mild topical Tretinoin (Treclin) which I find also works wonders.
