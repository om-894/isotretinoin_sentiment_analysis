mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,I didn‚Äôt break any of the Reddit rules. I didn‚Äôt post anything hateful bully or harass anyone or evade bans or use multiple accounts to upvote anything. Literally all I did is create this page. There must be some serious pharma shills reporting stuff to Reddit.
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Hi!
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that! :(
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Floxing is so awful üíîüíîüíî
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,I have several friends who are floxed üíî. Honestly i hate doctors and you can probably tell ü§£
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Wow! Give me like 5 min and I‚Äôll read this. Sorry. Someone is picking a fight with me right now üôÑugh these people are so annoying lol
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,"Kudos to you for calling out the pharmaceutical cartel that is literally poisoning us. That is not hyperbole it is not a ""conspiracy theory"". It is fact. It is my reality. It happened to me. I experienced widespread tendon peripheral nerve central nerve and vision issues after taking Ciprofloxacin an antibiotic of the fluoroquinolone class that has been putting marathon runners in wheelchairs for 30+ years. Doctors feign ignorance when you present back with symptoms and instead shift the blame back on you by claiming you came down with a mysterious severe autoimmune disorder overnight or better yet that it's ""all in your head"" (doctor ese for ""I'm not smart enough to help you but my ego can't admit it so you're faking"")"
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Either one of two things is happening when you get floxed and a doctor denies it: A. you are dealing with an evil corrupt person who knows he/she is poisoning and crippling healthy people but because of bribes profit fear of retaliation is willing to live with this as the cost of doing business. OR B. You are dealing with an ignorant fool who is not qualified to practice medicine and should have their license revoked immediately. Even the uber corrupt FDA is clear about FQ's. There are 4 black box warnings. It's common knowledge at this point. Any doctor still prescribing them for anything other than severe life threatening infections with signed informed consent from the patient or power of attorney should be charged with a violent crime. The rate of tendonitis on the insert is allegedly 0.14%. This is pathological. The chronic epididymitis subreddit has 700 members and dozens of floxies. The prostatitis forum has 4 000 members and hundreds of floxies. Fluoroquinlones are poison to 100% of human bodies. The only variable is the toxicity threshold. Some people are poisoned by do not have side effects because the drug has not yet impacted mitochondria but give someone enough and eventually the adverse reaction rate is 100%. Even the floxie community is largely in denial about this. They have stockholm syndrome for their poisoners and claim it's rare and that most people recover. More lies. If anyone here for accutane wants to learn more about floxing drop me a reply here or DM!
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Hi
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Wow omg
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Fuck reddit. I made this page but then was permanently banned from this account for literally no reason.
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,"u/informedconsent_ Yes indeed. I am convinced that the moderators at r/floxies the community for those poisoned by fluoroquinolone antibiotics are actually plants. They run with the narrative it is ""very rare"" and we are the unlucky few. They defend doctors are noble protectors who sometimes make innocent mistakes. They censor any questions about vaccines or ""conspiracy theories""."
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,That is soooo disappointing...
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Maybe someone should make a real floxie group instead of that shit
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Sorry I went back up to read your comment in here that I didn‚Äôt have a chance to see before
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,I completely agree with you üíØ % with everything you said. It‚Äôs a crime to prescribe these drugs. Some people have called it attempted murder and as radical as that sounds I agree. The lies they tell about how ‚Äúrare‚Äù the permanent or serious effects are are SUCH bullshit. Just like vaccines (they say ‚Äú1 in a million serious reaction‚Äù) they lie about all pharma drugs having incredibly rare effects when in reality they don‚Äôt
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,The reason I took this bullshit poison drug accutane is because I was lied to by my doc I was told that any serious or long term effect was ridiculously rare like 1/10 000. I considered my odds and figured that I had a higher chance of dying in an auto accident than getting some night vision loss or liver damage or whatever so I thought it sounded pretty reasonable. LIES. The actual truth is that about 1 in 10 people get permanent damaging effects from accutane. They never tell this to anyone though.
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,The only good thing about having been affected by accutane is that I'm extremely careful now with anything medical related. No doubt I would have hopped on finasteride otherwise for example.
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Who is behind these posts? I thanks for doing it whoever you are.
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,What country are you all from? I‚Äôm from the U.S. and it‚Äôs federal law to be well informed of all of these effects I received a huge very intimidating booklet with caution signs all over it. Did you all not receive this?
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,hi i‚Äôm supposed to be staring acutane in about 2 weeks for pretty mild cystic acne and after reading some of these posts i‚Äôm pretty much ready to quit before i‚Äôve even started. I already have anxiety ocd arthritis and i‚Äôm pretty terrified should i just end it before i hurt myself even more?
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,hi
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,i feel so alone i've been on it for 9 months with a dose of 20mg. i finished it i still have acne and scars now fine lines to worry about.
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,oh i just realized this was active 3 months ago... oopsie

mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,hey why was the last message here from 11 months ago?
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,hey I am really worried about developing worse side effects. dry eye and mental health shit is bad enough has anyone gone without developing anything worse?
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,People use this still?
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,I'm in exactly the same boat as you. I was terrified of taking accutane at first but my derm assured me that it wasn't capable of causing any harm and that all of those reports of side effects were completely false. i was 17 at the time and what 17 year questions their doctor if nothing bad has happened previously? of course I took her word for it! nearly 6 years later and I'm still paying the price of her arrogance and my unwillingness to question her
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,Me too. I have to take the best care of my body that I possibly can. Tons of rest tons of healthy supplements. I had to completely change my life or I felt like I was gonna die.
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,yes
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,i made it 3 months and now bleeding in the toilet having to get off of it. also hair is shedding a lot. i regret it at this point because i doubt my skin will even stay clear and now ill probably need a colonoscopy. had a clear one before i started
mxkw0j,r/AccutaneLies Lounge,A place for members of r/AccutaneLies to chat with each other,I‚Äôve off for almost 5 years now and I‚Äôm still dealing with harsh side effects.
ur3vl2,Does anyone feel like accutane is making their face swollen/puffy? I feel like mine is since taking it and I heard Emma chamberlain talk about this in her podcast about her accutane experience.,,i believe she said it was Spironolactone that made her puffy
ur3vl2,Does anyone feel like accutane is making their face swollen/puffy? I feel like mine is since taking it and I heard Emma chamberlain talk about this in her podcast about her accutane experience.,,Yea and unfortunately really saggy. It shortens the telomeres. Cell damage..
ur3vl2,Does anyone feel like accutane is making their face swollen/puffy? I feel like mine is since taking it and I heard Emma chamberlain talk about this in her podcast about her accutane experience.,,It has made my face so swollen in my last month and I felt like there was pressure in my head and I had to quit because it has given me tinnitus. But I don‚Äôt think it was the Accutane only. I wasn‚Äôt eating very well and lacked B12 and some other vitamins. Make sure you‚Äôre getting all your vitamins and not restrictive with your diet. I regret avoiding diary and animal based products. It really matters. I now have to go see many doctors to put my hormones and vitamins back to their normal levels

Now that‚Äôs a relief hahah I‚Äôm doing face massages daily while I do my skincare before bed it‚Äôs been helping a little

uqf6rt,lab testing levels,My son had 2 days of bizarre behavior which may have been caused by a seizure and/or isotretinoin. He's been on 80 mg/day for several months and weighs about 170 pounds (which I now realize is above recommended dosing). I pretty much demanded they do lab testing for isotrentinoin which they had to send to a specialty lab to even do. However I can't find any research that actually correlates lab level results for isotrentinoin with adverse symptoms (especially neuropsychiatric symptoms). If anyone has info or resources to point me to on this topic I'd really appreciate it!,i suggest lowering the mg/day my derm messed me up with all sorts of things so just trust your gut

If anyone has info or resources to point me to on this topic I'd really appreciate it!,Yeah definitely lower it. If I was you I would get him off of it. It‚Äôs not worth it at all. I was on 100mg and I was only 120 pounds at the time. I was on it for two years and been off it for 6months now and have severe side affects. You won‚Äôt really notice the side affects right away until you stop taking it. Then everything gets very severe. I have stomach issues now as well as liver damage and other organs that are not doing so well. Even a lot of people that had my experience has even said they have had the same issues as well especially coming off. I still had symptoms when I was on it. But not bad where it affected me. I had dry skin upset stomach sometimes joint and back pains as well as other symptoms. Just overall what I‚Äôm saying is don‚Äôt take it. They don‚Äôt realize how serious this drug is and how much damage it can do

For accutane you have to get your blood taken monthly and the doctor should be reviewing your results. I know I have access through Labcorps to see all my results check yours to see the labs per month.

Did you have any neurologic side effects such as seizures? Or psychological side effects that went away when you stopped the med? Thanks for sharing your story.

Yes he did have the renal & liver function tests (bc isotrentinoinis known to be toxic to liver & kidneys) but I'm still not able to find resources abt drug levels for isotrentinoin & they don't usually test for actual drug levels of isotrentinoin in someone's system.

If anyone has info or resources to point me to on this topic I'd really appreciate it!,Yes it has! Very very badly. My brain is not the same. And I have bipolar and it made it worst. It‚Äôs like having to restart on finding the right medication and I also gained severe depression. I also had really bad dizziness and passed out a lot. They don‚Äôt go away. I got told a lot of it by my friend that was on it that it goes a way after a year or so when off of it. But the bigger symptoms will stay. Such as psychological issues and neurological and the nerve system. I find any dermo shouldn‚Äôt be telling us what it‚Äôs like when they‚Äôve never been on it themselves. Telling us it‚Äôs ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù when really it‚Äôs the drug. How long has your son been on it? And if you don‚Äôt mind how old is he? I was 17 when I started it and got off around the end of when I was 19

s7x6sg,Permanent loss of skin pigment after accutane,I took roaccutane 3 years ago and it has permanently affected the pigment in my skin. I used to tan very easily and now I stay the same colour and accumulate freckles and moles (even if I wear SPF 50/70). This worries me as it's like I don't have any melanin protecting me from the sun. I thought my normal skin would come back but years later it has stayed the same since the roaccutane. I don't see anything about this online therefore have no idea what category this would be in for treatments or next steps. Has anyone experienced this?,I thought I was the only one for a while. Seem to be a lot more affected on my face than anywhere else tho. Not sure why

rosr9k,This is kinda a lie / a heads up for acccutane,Honestly once I was on accutane and started it I thought my skin at the end would be very clear (as they state). Accutane can help people with very very very bad acne but for ex people with mild acne that is still considered bad usually just purge extremely bad cause a ton of acne then in a month after it flattens and are left with so much scarring. That‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learnt while on accutane and it sucks (happening to me praying it changes though have 3 months left),Are you still on accutane for your acne?
